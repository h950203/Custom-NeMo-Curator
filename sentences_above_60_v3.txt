   It is a statutory requirement that a fire main and deck wash system should be supplied.

32. [점수: 100점]
   This has hose outlets on the various decks, and is supplied by power-driven pumps in the machinery spaces.

34. [점수: 100점]
   Air and sounding pipes Air pipes are provided for all tanks to prevent air being trapped under pressure in the tank when it is filled, or a vacuum being created when it is emptied.

35. [점수: 88점]
   Sounding pipes are provided to all tanks, and compartments not readily accessible and are located so that soundings are taken in the vicinity of the suctions, i.e. at the lowest point of the tank.

36. [점수: 100점]
   Each sounding pipe is made as straight as possible and is led above the bulkhead deck, except in some machinery spaces where this might not be practicable.

37. [점수: 86점]
   Underneath the sounding pipe a striking plate is provided where the sounding rod drops in the bilge well etc.

38. [점수: 100점]
   This opening is to have rounded corners and be kept clear of the bilge strake if possible.

   Oil tankers of 20,000 tonnes deadweight or more should have a fixed deck foam system and a fixed inert gas system.

49. [점수: 88점]
   On an oil tanker, inert gas may be produced by one of two processes: 1. Ships with main or auxiliary boilers normally use the flue gas, which contains typically only 2–4% by volume of oxygen.
