서 문 선박건조 및 수리업의 안전보건에 대한 국제노동기구(ILO) 실행규약은 제329차 ILO 이사회 (2017년 3월) 결정에 따라 2018년 1월 22일부터 26일까지 제네바에서 개최된 전문가회의에서 채택되었다.
동 회의에는 브라질, 중국, 이탈리아, 일본, 대한민국, 나이지리아, 필리핀, 싱가포르 정부가 임명한 8명, 이사회의 사업주 그룹이 임명한 8명 및 이사회의 근로자 그룹이 임명한 6명 등 22명의 전문가와 자문위원이 참석했다.
다른 정부의 전문옵서버와 정부간국제기구 및 NGO의 옵서버도 참여했다.
이 실행규약은 그간의 기술 및 기타 발전상황을 반영하지 못하는 1973년에 채택된 기존 규약을 대체한다.
새롭고 포괄적이며 실용적인 규약을 만들기 위해 모든 참석자들이 협력하여 합의를 이끌어낸 결과인 이 규약은 전세계 선박건조 및 수리분야의 안전보건 문제에 대한 인지도를 제고하고 관련 근로자의 건강, 사기 및 복지향상에 기여할 것이다.
규약 전문은 제334차 ILO 이사회(2018년 10월~11월)에서 출판이 승인되었다.
알레트 반 루어(Alette van Leur) 국장 분야별 정책부서 v
분야별 실행규약 ILO 분야별 실행규약은 특정 경제분야 또는 분야별 클러스터에서 정책, 전략, 프로그램, 법률, 행정조치 및 사회적 대화 메커니즘을 설계하고 구현하는데 반영될 수 있는 원칙을 설정하는 참조 수단이다.
분야별 실행규약은 정부, 사업주 및 근로자로 구성된 전문가회의에서 채택된다.
다양한 국가별 여건, 문화 그리고 사회적, 경제적, 환경적 및 정치적 배경에 따라 점진적으로 이행될 수 있다.
분야별 실행규약은 ILO 국제노동기준(협약 및 권고)과 ILO 총회 또는 이사회에서 채택하고 승인한 선언, 행동강령 및 정책지침 등의 자료를 바탕으로 원칙을 도출한다.
또한 해당 분야의 다른 국제협약과 정책뿐 아니라 지역과 국가의 법 및 관행에서 나타나는 관련 동향과 발전사항도 고려한다.
분야별 실행규약은 정부, 사업주 및 근로자가 우선시하고 특정 경제분야 및 산업에 고유한 이슈에 초점을 맞추고 있다.
국제노동기준이 통상적으로 노동법과 관행의 보다 일반적인 원칙을 다룬다면, 분야별 실행규약은 특정 작업장이나 상황에서 양질의 노동을 촉진하기 위해 이행할 수 있는 원칙과 프로세스를 명시한다.
분야별 실행규약은 관련 분야 전문가의 전문지식을 통해 업계의 우수한 관행과 혁신을 포착할 수 있다.
분야별 실행규약은 법적 구속력이 없다.
ILO의 국제노동기준에 따라 수립되는 비준이나 감독 메커니즘의 적용을 받지 않는다.
따라서 분야별 실행규약은 그 범위가 확장될 수 있고 국제노동기준 및 다른 국제협정과 정책에 규정된 원칙에 따라 확대 가능하며, 다양한 국가 시스템과 상황에 맞게 조정될 수 있다.
이처럼 ILO 총회나 이사회 또는 양 기구 모두 채택하고 승인한 ILO 기준 및 기타 수단이나 지침은 분야별 실행규약이 보다 발전할 수 있는 기초를 형성한다.
그러므로 분야별 실행규약은 국제노동기준에 명시된 모든 원칙, 권리 및 의무에 근거하며, 실행규약의 어떤 내용도 그러한 기준을 낮추는 것으로 해석되어서는 안 된다.

소 개 1.
2017년 3월 제329차 ILO 이사회 결정에 따라 선박건조 및 수리업의 안전보건에 대한 ILO 실행 규약(이하 “규약”) 개정안을 검토하고 채택하기 위한 선박건조 및 수리업 안전보건 전문가 회의가 2018년 1월 22일부터 26일까지 제네바에서 개최되었다.
이 회의는 이사회의 정부 그룹과 협의를 통해 임명된 8명의 전문가, 사업주 그룹과 협의를 통해 임명된 8명의 전문가 및 근로자 그룹과의 협의를 통해 임명된 6명의 전문가로 구성되었다.
2. 실행규약은 주로 예방, 보호 및 시정조치의 근거로 설계되며, 안전보건 분야에서 산업안전보건 (OSH)에 대한 ILO 기술 표준으로 간주된다.
이사회는 1973년 선박건조 및 수리업의 안전보건에 관한 실행규약 원안을 공표하는 것에 동의했으며 다음해 출판되었다.
이번에 개정된 규약은 해당 산업, 인력, 권한있는 기관, 선주, 사업주, 근로자 및 그 단체의 역할과 산업안전보건에 관한 ILO의 새로운 규범의 발전에 있어 그간 있었던 많은 변화를 반영한다.
제1장은 규약의 목적, 목표 및 용도에 대한 개요를 적시하고 있다.
제2장은 이해관계자의 일반 적인 의무, 책임, 임무 및 권리를 서술하고 있다.
제3장에서 제6장까지는 산업안전보건관리시스템, 변화관리, 산업안전보건 보고 및 안전보건 조직 등 일반원칙을 다루고 있다.
제7장에는 작업장에 서의 일반적인 예방 및 보호조치가, 제8장에서는 작업계획, 안전작업계획 및 안전작업허가제가 포 함되어 있다.
제9장은 선박건조 및 수리업에서 가장 일반적인 안전보건 요건을 간략히 서술한다.
제10장에서 제13장까지는 유해물질, 물리적·인체공학적·생물학적 유해요인을, 제14장은 공구, 기계 및 장비에 대한 안전요건을 다룬다.
제15장은 관리자, 근로자 및 도급업자의 역량과 교육을, 제16 장은 개인보호구(PPE)에 대한 지침을 포함한다.
마지막으로 제17장과 제18장은 특별보호 및 일반 복지를 위한 조치를 개괄하고 있다.
일반규정 1.1.

작업 5.
비일상적 작업의 위험을 관리하는데 있어 가장 중요한 것은 진행 전 확실한 평가를 수행하 기 위해 진행 중인 작업을 중단하는 것이다.
이를 통해 작업 개시 전에 상황에 대한 인식을 개 선할 수 있다.
파악된 비일상적 작업에 대응하는 방법에는 다음과 같은 것들이 있다.
(1) 감독자와 협의 (2) 진행하기 전 기존의 표준에 대한 “현장” 평가 수행 (3) 진행하기 전 기존의 표준에 대한 보다 공식적인 직무 안전분석 실시 (4) 해당 작업을 포괄하는 문서화된 절차나 안전작업계획의 개발 또는 보완 (5) 공식적인 위험성 평가 실시 및 적절한 관리방안 수립 또는 (6) 수립된 안전작업허가제의 이행(고소작업 또는 밀폐공간 작업과 같은 경우 통상적으로 사 용) 7.
신규 선박이나 장비를 도입하고 새로운 작업방법이 필요할 때마다 근로자에게 안전보건에 미치는 영향에 대한 정보와 훈련을 제공하는 데 특별한 주의를 기울여야 한다.
8. 선박건조 및 수리시설 개발과 운영의 가장 초기단계부터 이러한 접근을 지원하는 조치가 마 련되어야 한다.
비일상적 작업에 대한 “무대응”은 용납되지 않는다라는 점을 명확히 인지해야 한다.

HIV 관련 질병에 감염된 사람에게 그들이 의학적으로 적합한 한 지속적인 근무의 가능성을 부인해서는 안되며 필요한 경우 합리적인 편의시설을 제공해야 한다.
그들의 역량에 맞게 합리 적으로 변경된 작업에 재배치하거나 훈련을 통해 다른 작업을 부여 또는 업무로 복귀하도록 촉 진하는 조치들이 바람직하다.
직장에 HIV와 에이즈 정책 및 프로그램을 도입하는 것이 바람직하며 이의 성공적인 이행을 위해서는 사업주, 근로자 및 그 대표 간의 협력과 신뢰가 필요하다.
성적 지향에 관계없이 남녀 모두의 HIV 대응에 대한 적극적인 참여를 촉진해야 한다.
직장에서 HIV에 노출될 가능성이 있는 경우 근로자는 질병의 감염경로와 노출 및 감염예방 조치에 대한 교육과 훈련을 받아야 한다.
HIV가 일상적 신체접촉으로 감염되지 않으며 HIV 감 염자의 존재를 작업장 유해요인으로 간주해서는 안된다는 것을 강조하는 인식제고가 필요하다.
HIV 감염자나 에이즈 환자가 법정 사회보장 프로그램 및 산업보건서비스에 접근하고 그 혜 택을 받는 데 있어 차별이 있어서는 안 된다.
