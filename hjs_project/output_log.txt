[줄 38] [89.5%] (17/19) ✅ 유지 - The various available nondestructive testing methods may be summarized as follows: Visual examination Dye penetrant Magnetic particle Radiographic Ultrasonic.
[줄 39] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Of these five methods, the dye penetrant and magnetic particle tests have few applications in ship hull construction, being used for examining surface cracks in stern frames and other castings.
[줄 40] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Visual, radiographic, and ultrasonic examinations are considered in more detail, as they are in common use.
[줄 41] [92.6%] (25/27) ✅ 유지 - Magnetic particle testing is carried out by magnetizing the casting and spreading a fluid of magnetic particles e.g iron fillings suspended in paraffin on the surface.
[줄 42] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Any discontinuity such as a surface crack will show up as the particles will concentrate at this point where there is an alteration in the magnetic field.

[줄 44] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - To aid the detection of a surface crack the dye penetrant used is often luminous and is revealed under an ultraviolet light.
[줄 45] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Visual inspection of welds is routine procedure, and surface defects are soon noticed by the experienced inspector and surveyor.
[줄 46] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Incorrect bead shape, high spatter, undercutting, bad stop and start points, incorrect alignment, and surface cracks are all faults that may be observed at the surface.
[줄 47] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Subsurface and internal defects are not observed, but the cost of visual inspection is low, and it can be very effective where examination is made before, during, and after welding.
[줄 48] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - The principle of radiographic inspection is simply to subject a material to radiation from one side, and record the radiation emitted from the opposite side.
[줄 49] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Any obstacle in the path of the radiation will affect the radiation density emitted and may be recorded.
[줄 50] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - As radiation will expose photographic plate, for all practical weld test purposes this is used to record the consistency of the weld metal.
[줄 51] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - The photographic plate records changes in radiation density emitted; for example, a void will show up as a darker shadow on the radiograph.
[줄 52] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Either X-ray or gamma-ray devices may be used to provide the source of radiation.
[줄 53] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - X-ray equipment consists of a high-voltage power source, which is used to provide potential between a cathode and target anode in a glass vacuum tube.
[줄 54] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Only a small percentage of this energy is converted to X-rays, so that large amounts of heat have to be conducted away from the target.
[줄 55] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - From the target the X-rays are projected out of the tube onto the weld surface.
[줄 56] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Where gamma-ray devices are used ray emission is produced by decay of a radioactive nucleus, the rate of emission being reduced with time.

[줄 61] [92.3%] (24/26) ✅ 유지 - the g -rays being similar to X-rays and of most importance since they are very penetrating, but this also means that heavy shielding is required.
[줄 62] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Since natural radioactive sources are in short supply, great use is made of artificial radioactive sources, namely isotopes.
[줄 63] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - To interpret the weld radiograph a large amount of experience is required, and a sound knowledge of the welding process.
[줄 64] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - Radiographs usually carry the image of an 'image quality indicator', which shows the minimum change of thickness revealed by the technique.
[줄 65] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - This image quality indicator may have graded steps of metal, each step being identified on the radiograph so that the minimum step thickness discernible is noted and the sensitivity of the radiograph assessed.
[줄 66] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - This indicator is placed adjacent to the weld prior to taking the radiograph.
[줄 67] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Ultrasonic energy is commonly used as a tool for locating defects in welds, and has several advantages over radiography, particularly as no health hazard is involved.
[줄 68] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The technique is particularly useful for locating fine cracks that are often missed by radiography, particularly where they lie perpendicular to the emission source.
[줄 69] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - The principle of ultrasonic inspection depends on the fact that pulses of ultrasonic energy are reflected from any surface that they encounter.
[줄 70] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Ultrasonic waves traveling through a plate may be reflected from the surface of the metal and also from the surfaces of any flaws that exist in the metal.
[줄 71] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Virtually total reflection occurs at an air–metal interface, and therefore to get the ultrasonic wave into the metal a liquid is placed between the source and metal.
[줄 72] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - The pattern of reflection is revealed on a cathode ray tube, which may be calibrated using a standard reference block.
[줄 73] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - An experienced operator is able to recognize flaws from the cathode ray tube display, and to some extent recognition of defect types is possible.
[줄 74] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Apart from weld inspection, ultrasonic techniques are valuable for assessing the thickness of structural members.
[줄 75] [92.6%] (25/27) ✅ 유지 - Classi fi cation society weld tests Classification societies specify a number of destructive tests that are intended to be used for initial electrode and weld material approval.
[줄 76] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - These tests are carried out to ascertain whether the electrode or wire-flux combination submitted is suitable for shipbuilding purposes in the category specified by the manufacturer.
[줄 77] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - Tests are made for conventional electrodes, deep penetration electrodes, wire-gas and wire-flux combinations, consumables for electro-slag and electro-gas welding, and consumables for one-sided welding with temporary backing.
[줄 78] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Tensile, bend, and impact tests are carried out on the deposited weld metal and welded plate specimens.
[줄 79] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Other tests are made for the composition of the weld metal deposited and possible cracking.

[줄 86] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Iron, rapidly followed by steel, construction resulted in shipbuilding moving to areas where raw materials, primarily coal and iron ore, were available.
[줄 87] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - These were also often areas where the basic metalworking skills were to be found as the basis for the labor force, or in some cases a labor force was moved into the area.
[줄 88] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Shipyards were usually found along river banks, or in protected harbors, giving sheltered water and their basic arrangement did not vary.
[줄 89] [78.6%] (11/14) ✅ 유지 - Figure 11.1 shows the typical arrangement of a shipyard up to around 1960.
[줄 90] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The slipways on which the ships are constructed piece by piece are supported by small and simple workshops.
[줄 91] [81.8%] (9/11) ✅ 유지 - There was a relatively small Figure 11.1 'Traditional' riverside layout.

[줄 93] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - initial investment and the output could be varied by opening or closing building slipways and taking on or laying off labor.
[줄 94] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - The layout of a shipyard did not vary significantly until the mid 1950s.
[줄 95] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - A relatively small number of shipyards engaged in capital warship construction or passenger ships, where the product is significantly larger and more complex than average commercial ships.
[줄 96] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - These had extensive outfitting workshops and quays, as well as larger slipways.
[줄 97] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Large cranes, almost always fixed in position, were available to lift heavy items, perhaps 200 tonnes for large, complex ships.
[줄 98] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - However, for the lifting of hull parts and most outfitting the available lifting capacity was usually below 10 tonnes.
[줄 99] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - The major change in the shipyards came about initially because of rapid increases in commercial ship size after 1950.
[줄 100] [76.0%] (19/25) ✅ 유지 - At that time a typical cargo ship was of below 10,000 deadweight tonnes, and a tanker of 20,000 deadweight tonnes was considered large.
[줄 101] [65.2%] (15/23) ✅ 유지 - By 1958, the first tanker over 100,000 deadweight tones was in operation and the first over 200,000 tonnes deadweight by 1966.
[줄 102] [72.7%] (8/11) ✅ 유지 - By 1970, 250,000-tonne and larger ships were being built.
[줄 103] [81.8%] (18/22) ✅ 유지 - An important aspect of these newer ships was a tenfold increase in steelweight, from a typical 3000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes.
[줄 104] [91.7%] (11/12) ✅ 유지 - Also, the largest ships were in excess of 300 meters in length.
[줄 105] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - As such, they were too large for most existing shipyards' slipways and the lifting capacities of the small cranes usually available would have meant an excessive construction time.
[줄 106] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The result was first that existing shipyards reduced the number of slipways and increased the size of their cranes as the ship size increased.
[줄 107] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - This allowed them to construct the ships in a shorter time, so keeping the construction time acceptable.
[줄 108] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - A very few European shipyards increased the slipway sizes and cranes to be able to build VLCCs.
[줄 109] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - However, the 1960s saw the emergence of a substantial number of new shipyards, primarily in Asia but also in Europe, which were purpose designed for the new, large ships.
[줄 110] [97.4%] (38/39) ✅ 유지 - The basic arrangement was established by the mid 1960s in Japan, and many shipyards built subsequently, including in Eastern Europe, and more recently in South Korea, China and now Vietnam, have been specifically planned to construct the larger ships.
[줄 111] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The contemporary shipbuilding practices and production methods have improved but the basic technology and main equipment has been consistent for the last half century.
[줄 112] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - A number of traditional shipbuilders, which were often based on river banks, also established new yards where they could build larger ships and/or exploit the new technology and production methods.
[줄 113] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - In general, the smaller shipbuilders have been able to reconfigure their site in order to utilize new technology and improve production, whilst continuing to build smaller and medium-sized ships.
[줄 114] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - In many cases the shipyards are constrained as to the size and type of ship that can be built.
[줄 115] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Many smaller shipyards have adopted total undercover construction, providing a dry, warm environment.
[줄 116] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Undercover ship construction has been extended to some larger ships, including many military ships and also passenger ships, especially in Northern Europe.
[줄 117] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - As in the early days of such large ships, where the shipyards differed from the routine, the complexity and cost of the ship can justify the massive capital expenditure on covered facilities.
[줄 118] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - An ideal layout for a modern shipyard is based on a production flow basis, as in Figure 11.2, with the shipyard built on a greenfield site and no longer, as with existing
[줄 119] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - shipyards, having to follow the river bank.
[줄 120] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - This removes typical restrictions on old sites, restricted by their location in a built-up area or the physical river bank slope from extending back from the river, so that modified production flow lines are required.
[줄 121] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - The sequence of layout development is outlined below.
[줄 122] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - It should be noted that particular locations and circumstances can dictate significantly different arrangements that may not be ideal but that do work.
[줄 123] [100.0%] (45/45) ✅ 유지 - Planning a new shipyard, or re-planning an existing one, will involve decisions to be made on the following: Size and type of ship to be built Number of ships per year to be achieved Breakdown of the ships into structural blocks and outfit modules

[줄 125] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Shipyards usually have a fitting out basin or berth where the virtually completed ship is tied up after launching and the finishing off work and static trails may be carried out.
[줄 126] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Some of the facilities identified may be omitted from the shipyard and a subcontractor used instead.
[줄 127] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - This will depend on the location, availability of subcontractors, and the economics of the alternatives.

[줄 129] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - Before considering the actual layout of the shipyard, it is as well to consider the relationship of the work processes involved in building a ship, as illustrated in Figure 11.3.
[줄 130] [95.5%] (42/44) ✅ 유지 - An idealized layout of a new shipyard is indicated in Figure 11.4, which might be appropriate for a smaller yard specializing in one or two standard type ships with a fairly high throughput so that one covered building dock or berth is sufficient.
[줄 131] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - At this point it may be convenient to mention the advantages and disadvantages of building docks as opposed to building berths.
[줄 132] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Building docks can be of advantage in the building of large vessels where launching costs are high, and there is a possibility of structural damage owing to the large stresses imposed by a conventional launch.
[줄 133] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - They also give good crane clearance for positioning units.
[줄 134] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - The greatest disadvantage of the building dock is its high initial cost.
[줄 135] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - However, the dock is the usual choice for new shipyards, especially for larger ships.
[줄 136] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - The level base simplifies the construction process, for example alignment of structural blocks.
[줄 137] [94.7%] (71/75) ✅ 유지 - Also, the dock is more flexible in operation, for example in some cases ships are built in two stages with the outfit and Plate stowage Section stowage Shot-blast/prime Shot-blast/prime Cutting Marking Shaping Bending cutting Subassemblies Panel assemblies Matrix assemblies Curved unit assemblies Block assembly Block and unit erection Final outfit Outfit palletization and modules Outfit fabrication and assembly Pipe bending Outfit materials and bought in items Figure 11.3 Shipbuilding process.

[줄 307] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Stockyard On arrival at the shipyard, plates and sections are temporarily stored in the stockyard.
[줄 308] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - In larger shipyards the stockyard is an uncovered space having sufficient area to provide storage for enough plates and sections required for the working of the yard some months ahead.
[줄 309] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The stockyard is needed because the production schedule of a steelmaker will not conform to the needs of one particular shipyard.
[줄 310] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Also, the shipyard may not be located near a steelmaker and may choose to purchase steel from another country if prices are lower.
[줄 311] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - The stockyard ensures there is always steel to maintain production.
[줄 312] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - In some cases the quantity of steel in storage might be about three months' stock, but shipyards in countries that are not substantial steel producers may find it necessary to carry much larger stocks of material.
[줄 313] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - In contrast, Far East shipyards closely associated with and/or located near a steel manufacturer may carry as little as one month's stock, and in some cases less.
[줄 314] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - When the plates and sections are ordered the steel mills are provided with details of the identification code for each item so that they may be marked.
[줄 315] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - On arrival in the stockyard, since the coding is generally in terms of the unit structure for which each item is intended, it is convenient to store the plates and sections in their respective ship and ship unit areas.
[줄 316] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - In other words the material for each ship is allotted an area of the stockyard, this area being subdivided into plots for those items intended for a major structural fabrication block of the ship.
[줄 317] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Smaller shipyards may choose to buy steel from a stockist, removing the need for a stockyard, which is an expensive facility.

[줄 331] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - This is a set of plate-straightening rolls through which the plate is passed prior to its being worked.
[줄 332] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - During production at the steelworks, the plates may acquire locked-in stresses, which are released with the use of thermal processes in the shipyard.
[줄 333] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - This can cause distortion, which slows production.
[줄 334] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Also, during transit to the shipyard, plates may become distorted, and for many of the modern machining processes it is important that the plates should be as flat as practicable.
[줄 335] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Two sets of rolls may be provided, one for heavy plate and one for light plate, but types are now available that permit a wide range of thicknesses to be straightened.

[줄 337] [90.9%] (10/11) ✅ 유지 - The principles of shot-blasting are dealt with in Chapter 27.
[줄 338] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Shot-blasting plant in shipyards is generally of the impeller wheel type, where the abrasive is thrown at high velocity against the steel surface and may be recirculated.
[줄 339] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The plant is installed so that the plate may pass through in the horizontal position, which allows the use of automated, roller conveyor systems.
[줄 340] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The only disadvantage of the horizontal plant is the removal of spent abrasive from the top of the plate, which may be relatively easily overcome.
[줄 341] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - The shot is recovered and recycled.
[줄 342] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - As it breaks down into smaller pieces, the mix of whole shot and fragments assists the blasting process.
[줄 343] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - Spent shot and debris is removed for disposal.
[줄 344] [100.0%] (5/5) ✅ 유지 - The whole process is enclosed.

[줄 346] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Priming paint Following the shot-blasting of plates and sections, the material passes immediately through an airless spray painting plant.
[줄 347] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - In one pass the material is automatically sprayed with a priming paint of controlled coat thickness.
[줄 348] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - A number of suitable priming paints are available; the requirements for these and their formulation may be found in Chapter 27.
[줄 349] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Following the priming paint stage a drying process may be provided.
[줄 350] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - This is a tunnel with fans to create an airstream, in conjunction with the preheating, so that the plate that emerges is dry and ready for processing.
[줄 351] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - The drying also reduces the potential for damage to the primer coating.
[줄 352] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Smaller shipyards that do not use large quantities of steel can purchase the material ready shot-blasted and primed by a supplier, which eliminates the expensive preparation equipment.
[줄 353] [94.7%] (36/38) ✅ 유지 - Plate handling in machine shops Throughout the machining shops, overhead electric cranes having capacities from 5 to 30 tonnes, depending on the ship and material sizes, are normally used to transport plates and sections to each machine process.
[줄 354] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Individual machines may have jib cranes mounted on the frame that can be employed to handle the plate during the machining process.

[줄 358] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - This is particularly true of the methods adopted for fitting plates and frames to the curve of the hull, but as we have seen in the previous chapter the information for doing this can now be derived using the CAD/CAM systems available.
[줄 359] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Cutting flat plates to the required profiles has become highly automated, very sophisticated machine tools having been introduced for this purpose.
[줄 360] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - In the main, cutting is achieved by the use of an oxy-fuel flame or plasma arcs.
[줄 361] [91.7%] (22/24) ✅ 유지 - Plate pro fi le cutting machines Where a plate is to be cut into one or more complicated shapes, a profiling machine is employed.

[줄 363] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - In this case the computer-generated information on the plate geometry is fed directly to the cutting machine.
[줄 364] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The information is processed so that, in addition to the shape of the plate part, the start and finish of cutting, the speed of cutting, and information to mark the plate are provided.
[줄 365] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Marking is generally done using an inkjet printing system, although some machines use a powder that is fused onto the plate using the gas heating.
[줄 366] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Provision can also be made for the shrinkage of the plate part as it cools after cutting.
[줄 367] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The predicted shrinkage of the plate part is added to the nominal dimensions from the CAD system, so after cooling the part size is correct.

[줄 372] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - A full-size template or drawing may be used to control a cutting machine, and can be useful where a single small item is to be cut in large numbers.
[줄 373] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The size of the item is obviously restricted, and the location from which the item is cut in a large plate is selected by the operator.
[줄 374] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Where a template is used a mechanical follower may be employed, and where a drawing is used an electronic scanning device may follow the outline.

[줄 378] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - More basic cutting systems are likely to be found in very small shipyards and in ship repair.
[줄 379] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Planing machines Profiling machines are essentially for use where a plate requires extensive shaping with intricate cuts being made.
[줄 380] [97.6%] (41/42) ✅ 유지 - Many of the plates in the ship's hull, particularly those in straightforward plate panels, decks, tank tops, bulkheads, and side shell, will only require trimming and edge preparation, and perhaps some shallow curves may need to be cut in shell plates.
[줄 381] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - This work may be carried out on a planing machine, usually a flame or plasma-arc planer.
[줄 382] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - A flame planer consists basically of three beams carrying burning heads and running on two tracks, one either side of the plate working area.
[줄 383] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - One beam carries two burning heads for trimming the plate sides during travel, whilst the other two beams have a single burning head traversing the beam in order to trim the plate ends.

[줄 385] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Plate, beam, and burning head positioning is manual, but cutting conditions are maintained once set.
[줄 386] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Mechanical planing machines were in existence prior to the flame planer, and have an advantage where they are able to cut materials other than steels.
[줄 387] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Higher cutting speeds than that obtained with flame cutting may be obtained for vertical edges with a rotary shearing wheel on a carriage, where the plate is held by hydraulic clamping.
[줄 388] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - For edge preparations, older machines with a conventional planing tool require a large number of passes and are much slower than flame planers.
[줄 389] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - There are, however, merits in mechanically machined edge preparations where the superior finish is advantageous for critical welds.
[줄 390] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The use of plasma-arc planers, which also provide a superior and faster cut, tends to make the use of mechanical planers obsolete.
[줄 391] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Drilling machines Some plates or sections may need to have holes drilled in them, for example bolted covers and portable plates.
[줄 392] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Drilling machines generally consist of a single drilling head mounted on a radial arm that traverses the drill bed.
[줄 393] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Guillotines Smaller 'one-off' plate shapes such as beam knees, various brackets, and flat bar lengths may be cut in a hydraulically operated guillotine.
[줄 394] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Plate feed to the guillotine is usually assisted by the provision of plate-supporting roller castors, and positioning of the cut edge is by hand.
[줄 395] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Presses Hydraulic presses may be extensively used in the shipyard for a variety of purposes.
[줄 396] [81.8%] (9/11) ✅ 유지 - They are capable of bending, straightening, flanging, dishing, and swaging plates
[줄 397] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - All of the work is done with the plate cold, and it is possible to carry out most of the work undertaken by a set of rolls.
[줄 398] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This is done at less capital cost, but the press is slower when used for bending and requires greater skill.
[줄 399] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Plate rolls Heavy-duty bending rolls used for rolling shell plates etc to the correct curvature are hydraulically operated.
[줄 400] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Two lower rolls are provided and are made to revolve in the same direction so that the plate is fed between them and a slightly larger diameter top roll that runs idly.
[줄 401] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Either or both ends of the top roll may be adjusted for height, and the two lower rolls have adjustable centers.
[줄 402] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - With modern bending rolls, plates up to 45 mm thick may be handled and it is possible to roll plates into a half circle.
[줄 403] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - These large rolls are also supplied with accessories to allow them to undertake heavy flanging work with the pressure exerted by the upper beam, for example 'troughing' corrugated bulkhead sections.
[줄 404] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Shorter pyramid full-circle rolls are also used in shipyards, these being very useful for rolling plates to a full circle.
[줄 405] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - This may be done to obtain large mast and derrick post sections for example, or bow thruster tunnel.
[줄 406] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Arrangements are made for removing the rolled full-circle plate by releasing the top roller end bearing.

[줄 408] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Heat-line bending The 'heat-line' bending procedure is a widely used technique to obtain curvature in steel plates for shipbuilding purposes.
[줄 409] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - It is, however, a process that until recently relied on highly skilled personnel and did not guarantee constant accuracy of shapes formed.

[줄 411] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Heat is applied in a line to the surface of a plate by a flame torch, with immediate cooling using air or water.
[줄 412] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The narrow heated line of material is prevented from expanding in the direction of the plate surface by the large mass of cold plate, and therefore expands outwards perpendicular to the plate surface.
[줄 413] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - On cooling, contraction will take place in the direction of the plate surface, causing the plate to become concave on the side to which heat was applied.
[줄 414] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - An experienced operator is able to make a pattern of such heat lines on a plate, producing controlled distortion to obtain a required shape.
[줄 415] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - Heat-line bending can be more time consuming than using rolls or presses, but it has an advantage in that the plate holds its form more accurately when stiffening and other members are added later in the fabrication process.
[줄 416] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This is an important consideration since shape inaccuracy can be critical at the erection stage in terms of lost production time.
[줄 417] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Heat-line bending may be used after cold forming to obtain improved accuracy.
[줄 418] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - It is also used where a double curvature is required, for example on bulbous bow plates.
[줄 419] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - In recent years fully automated heat-line bending systems have been developed and installed in shipyards.

[줄 422] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Frame bending The traditional system of bending side frames may still be in use for repair work, and is described as follows.
[줄 423] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - A 'set-bar', which is a flat bar of soft iron, is bent to the scrieve line of the frame on the scrieve board and then taken to the frame bending slabs.
[줄 424] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - On these solid cast-iron slabs pierced with holes the line of the frame is marked, and modified to agree with the line of the toe of the frame.
[줄 425] [100.0%] (42/42) ✅ 유지 - As the heated frame on cooling will tend to bend, the set-bar is sprung to allow for this change in curvature before it is fixed down on the bending slabs by means of 'dogs' and pins inserted in the slab holes.
[줄 426] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Whilst the set-bar is being fixed the frame section is heated in a long oil-fired furnace adjacent to the bending slabs.
[줄 427] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - When at the right temperature it is pulled out onto the slabs and fixed with dogs and pins against the set-bar, as quickly as possible.
[줄 428] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Tools are available for forcing the frame round against the set-bar, including a portable hydraulic ram, and the toe of the web may require constant hammering to avoid buckling under compression.
[줄 429] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - As the frames fitted have their webs perpendicular to the ship's center line, all except those immediately amidships will require beveling.
[줄 430] [100.0%] (50/50) ✅ 유지 - A beveling machine is available that is placed in front of the furnace door, and as the frame is removed it passes between its rollers, which are controlled so that the flange is bent at every point to an angle indicated by a bevel board prepared by the mold loft.
[줄 431] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Once bent, the bar is put aside to cool, but is fastened down to prevent its warping in the vertical direction.
[줄 432] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - When cold it is checked against the frame line drawn on the slabs.
[줄 433] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Meanwhile, the set-bar is turned over and used to bend the corresponding frame for the opposite side of the ship.

[줄 635] [88.5%] (23/26) ✅ 유지 - longitudinals, stiffeners, etc may be left unwelded across unit seams and butts until these are completed in a similar manner to that described in Chapter 10.
[줄 636] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - In erecting units tolerances are a problem, more so on three-dimensional units than with two-dimensional units, and particularly at the shaped ends of the ship where 'green' material is still often left.
[줄 637] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Quality control procedures in the manufacturing shops to ensure correct dimensioning and alignment are very necessary if timeconsuming, expensive, and arduous work at the berth is to be avoided.
[줄 638] [100.0%] (48/48) ✅ 유지 - Improvements in this area have been made with the use of accurate jigs for curved shell units, planned weld sequences, and the use of lower heat input welding equipment, dimensional checks on piece parts, and the use of laser alignment tools for setting up data and checking interfaces.
[줄 639] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - More recently, the use of digital photogrammetry has been adopted in some shipyards.
[줄 640] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Photographs of a unit, or of an assembly at an earlier production stage, are taken from several locations and software then converts the image data into an accurate, three-dimensional view of the unit.
[줄 641] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This is useful in the alignment of units and in ensuring successive units are assembled to fit those already in place.
[줄 642] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Tolerance allowance data is built up with experience and can become very accurate when building standard ships.
[줄 643] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - A number of large shipbuilding firms building the super tankers, large chemical carriers, bulk carriers, etc may assemble much larger 'mega-blocks' that can be the full width of the ship.
[줄 644] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - These are transported to the building berth or a building dock, lifted into place and joined.
[줄 645] [83.3%] (20/24) ✅ 유지 - Rather than erecting 100–150 units at the berth or dock, they may only have to place and join as few as 10–15.
[줄 646] [100.0%] (46/46) ✅ 유지 - Joining ship sections a fl oat Owing to the enormous increase in size of bulk carriers and tankers, some shipyards with restricted facilities, building berth or dock size in particular, have resorted in the past to building the ship in two halves and joining these afloat.
[줄 647] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - This is not a very efficient process and is adopted as an expedient only.
[줄 648] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Where the two sections are to be joined afloat, extremely accurate fit-up of the sections is aided by the possibility of ballasting the two ship halves.
[줄 649] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The two sections may then be pulled together by tackles, and for the finer adjustments hydraulic cylinders may be used, extremely accurate optical instruments being employed to mark off the sections for alignment.
[줄 650] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - One method adopted is that where a cofferdam is arranged in way of the joint, a caisson is brought up against the ship's hull, and the cofferdam and caisson are pumped dry.
[줄 651] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - To balance any tendency for the vessel to hog during the pumping of the cofferdam, it is necessary to shift ballast in the fore and aft sections.
[줄 652] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Once the spaces are dried out, welding of the complete joint may be undertaken, the resulting weld being X-rayed to test the soundness of such a critical joint.
[줄 653] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - On completion of the paint scheme in way of the joint the caisson is removed.
[줄 654] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - A similar method makes use of a rubber 'U' form ring rather than a caisson, which needs modification for each ship size.
[줄 655] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - If a dry dock is available the sections may be aligned afloat and even welded above the waterline, the rest of the joint or the complete joint being secured by strongbacks.

[줄 664] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This chapter identifies the various means of transferring a ship from the land on which it is constructed to the water.
[줄 665] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The traditional end launching process is described as this is the most complex method.
[줄 666] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - End launching is now less common as most newer shipyards have a building dock.
[줄 667] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Other methods are less common and include side launching, a ship lift, a floating dock, or a pontoon.
[줄 668] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Whilst many modern shipyards now construct ships in building docks and float them out and some utilize ship lifts, a good number of long-established shipyards are still launching ships in the traditional manner.
[줄 669] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - A significant advance has been provided by computer programs that allow prior assessment of the performance of the ship and the loading it may experience during the launch, both on the ways and in the water.
[줄 670] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - Launching involves the transference of the weight of the ship from the keel blocks, shores, etc on which it was supported during construction, to a cradle on which it is allowed to slide into the water.
[줄 671] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Normally the vessel is launched end on, stern first, but a number of shipyards located on rivers or other narrow channels are obliged to launch the vessel sideways.
[줄 672] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Vessels have been launched bow first, but this was a rare occurrence as the buoyancy and weight moments, as well as the braking force, are generally more favorable when the vessel is launched stern first.
[줄 673] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - There is also a danger of damage to propellers and rudders as the ship leaves the end of the slipway.
[줄 674] [100.0%] (3/3) ✅ 유지 - All rights reserved.
[줄 675] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - End launches On release of a holding mechanism the launching cradle with the ship slides down the ground ways under the action of gravity.
[줄 676] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - When the stern has entered the water the vessel is partly supported by buoyancy and partly by the ground ways.
[줄 677] [100.0%] (41/41) ✅ 유지 - If this buoyancy is inadequate after the center of gravity of the ship has passed the way ends, the ship may tip about the way ends, causing large pressures on the bottom shell and on the ends of the ground ways.
[줄 678] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - To avoid this the greatest depth of water over the way ends should be utilized, and the ground ways extended into the water if necessary.
[줄 679] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Where this proves impossible it becomes necessary to strengthen the way ends and provide shoring in the bottom shell region, which is likely to be damaged.
[줄 680] [100.0%] (5/5) ✅ 유지 - These remedies are often expensive.
[줄 681] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - As the vessel travels further into the water the buoyancy becomes sufficient to lift the stern.
[줄 682] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - The vessel then pivots about the forward poppets, i.e the fore end of the launching cradle.
[줄 683] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - These are designed to take the load thrown on them by the pivoting action, the load being widely distributed in order not to squeeze out the lubricant between the sliding surfaces.
[줄 684] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Shoring may also be found necessary forward in the ship to prevent structural damage at the time the stern lifts.
[줄 685] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Building slipway Conventional slipways or berths are relatively solid and reinforced with piles to allow them to sustain the weights of ships built upon them.
[줄 686] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - During building the keel blocks take the greater part of the weight, the remainder being carried by shores and, where used, bilge blocks.
[줄 687] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Foundations under the probable positions of ground ways should also be substantial, since during a launch the ways are subject to large pressures.
[줄 688] [85.7%] (30/35) ✅ 유지 - Keel blocks are arranged so that the height of keel above the ground is 1.25– 1.5 m, giving reasonable access, but not too high so that a large amount of packing is required.
[줄 689] [97.1%] (33/34) ✅ 유지 - At the bow the height of the keel must be sufficient to allow the ship's forefoot to dip the required amount without striking the ground during pivoting when the stern lifts at launch.
[줄 690] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - To suit the declivity of the launching ways determined beforehand, the keel is also inclined to the horizontal at about 1 in 20, or more where the shipyard berths have a larger slope.
[줄 691] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - To transfer the ship from the building blocks to the launching cradle, the commonest practice is to drive wedges into the launching cradle.
[줄 692] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - This lifts the ship and permits the removal of the keel and bilge blocks together with the shores.
[줄 693] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - In large ships it becomes necessary to split the blocks to remove them, but several types of collapsible blocks have been used to overcome this difficulty.
[줄 694] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - One type is the sand box, which contains sand to a depth of 80–100 mm held in a steel frame located between two of the wooden blocks.
[줄 695] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - This steel frame may be removed and the sand allowed to run out.
[줄 696] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Another type is a wooden block sawn diagonally, the two halves being bolted so that they collapse on removal of the bolts.
[줄 697] [91.7%] (22/24) ✅ 유지 - REINFORCED BERTH Bilge blocks Shore Space for launching ways Keel blocks Shore Concrete Space for launching ways Bilge blocks Figure 15.1 Building blocks.
[줄 698] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Launching ways and cradle The fixed ground ways or standing ways on which the cradle and ship slide may be straight or have a fore and aft camber.
[줄 699] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - Transversely the ground ways are normally laid straight but can be canted inwards to suit the ship's rise of floor.
[줄 700] [92.6%] (25/27) ✅ 유지 - Usually, the ground ways have a small uniform fore and aft camber, say 1 in 400, the ways being the arc of a circle of large radius.
[줄 701] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This means that the lower part of the ways has a greater declivity than the upper part of the ways.
[줄 702] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - As a result a greater buoyancy for the same travel of the ship beyond the way ends is obtained, which will reduce the way end pressures.
[줄 703] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Additional advantages are increased water resistance slowing the vessel and a bow height that is not excessive.
[줄 704] [100.0%] (41/41) ✅ 유지 - The slope of ground ways must be adequate to allow the vessel to start sliding and, if too steep, a large amount of shoring will be required to support the bow; also, the loads on the releasing arrangements will be high.
[줄 705] [75.0%] (12/16) ✅ 유지 - Straight sliding ways have declivities of the order of 1 in 25 to 1 in 16.
[줄 706] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Generally two ground ways are fitted, the distance between the ways being about one-third the beam of the ship.
[줄 707] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - It is often desirable that the cradle should be fitted in way of longitudinal structural members and the ground ways over slipway piling, these considerations deciding the exact spacing.
[줄 708] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Some large ships have been launched on as many as four ways, and in Germany and the Netherlands it is common practice to launch vessels on a single center-line ground way.
[줄 709] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - The width of the ways should be such that the launching weight of the ship does not produce pressures exceeding about 20 tonnes per square meter.
[줄 710] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Ground ways are laid on supporting blocks and extend down to the low water mark so that they are covered by at least 1 meter of water at high tide.
[줄 711] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - To guide the sliding ways as they move over the ground ways, a ribband may be fitted to the outer edge of the ground ways.
[줄 712] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - This could be fitted to the inner edge of the sliding ways, but when fitted to the ground ways has the advantage that it aids retention of the lubricating grease.
[줄 713] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Finally, the ground ways are shored transversely to prevent sideways movement and longitudinally to prevent them from moving down with the ship.
[줄 714] [95.7%] (44/46) ✅ 유지 - The sliding ways, covering about 80% of the length of the vessel, form the lower part of the cradle, the upper part consisting of packing, wedges, and baulks of timber with some packing fitted neatly to the line of the hull in way of the framing.
[줄 715] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - In very fine-lined vessels the forward end of the cradle, referred to as the forward poppet, will need to be relatively high, and may be built up of vertical timber props tied together by stringers or ribbands.
[줄 716] [88.0%] (22/25) ✅ 유지 - This forward poppet will experience a maximum load that may be as much as 20–25% of the ship's weight when the stern lifts.
[줄 717] [97.6%] (40/41) ✅ 유지 - It is therefore designed to carry a load of this magnitude, but there is a danger in the fine-lined vessel of the forward poppets being forced outwards by the downward force, i.e the bow might break through the poppets.
[줄 718] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - To prevent this, cross ties or spreaders may be passed below the forefoot of the vessel and brackets may be temporarily fastened to the shell plating at the heads of the poppets.
[줄 719] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - In addition, saddle plates taken under the forefoot of the ship with packing between them and the shell may be fitted to transmit the load to the fore poppets and hence ground ways.
[줄 720] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - In many modern ships the bow sections are relatively full and little support is required above the fore end of the sliding ways.
[줄 721] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - Here short plate brackets may be
[줄 722] [77.1%] (54/70) ✅ 유지 - 3 Development of ship types Chapter Outline Dry cargo ships 17 Container ships 21 Barge-carrying ships 21 Ro-ro ships 21 Hull form 23 Cargo handling equipment 23 Bulk carriers 23 Car carriers 26 Oil tankers 26 Passenger ships 30 Further reading 33 A breakdown into broad working groups of the various types that the shipbuilder or ship designer might be concerned with are shown in Figure 3.1.
[줄 723] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - This covers a wide range and reflects the adaptability of the shipbuilding industry.
[줄 724] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - It is obviously not possible to cover the construction of all those types in a single volume.
[줄 725] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The development of the vessels with which the text is primarily concerned, namely dry cargo ships, tankers and passenger ships, follows.
[줄 726] [94.1%] (32/34) ✅ 유지 - Dry cargo ships If the development of the dry cargo ship from the time of introduction of steam propulsion is considered, the pattern of change is similar to that shown in Figure 3.2.
[줄 727] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - The first steam ships followed in most respects the design of the sailing ship, having a flush deck with the machinery openings protected only by low coamings and glass skylights.
[줄 728] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - At quite an early stage it was decided to protect the machinery openings with an enclosed bridge structure.
[줄 729] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Erections forming a forecastle and poop were also introduced at the forward and after respectively for protection.
[줄 730] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - This resulted in what is popularly known as the 'three island type'.
[줄 731] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - A number of designs at that time also combined bridge and poop, and a few combined bridge and forecastle, so that a single well was formed.
[줄 732] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - Another form of erection introduced was the raised quarter deck.
[줄 733] [78.6%] (11/14) ✅ 유지 - Raised quarter decks were often associated with smaller deadweight carrying vessels, e.g colliers.
[줄 734] [100.0%] (3/3) ✅ 유지 - All rights reserved.
[줄 735] [88.2%] (15/17) ✅ 유지 - temporarily welded between the shell plating and heavy plate wedge rider, as illustrated in Figure 15.2.
[줄 736] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - The design of the forward poppets is based on greater pressures than the lubricant between the sliding ways and ground ways could withstand if applied for any length of time.
[줄 737] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - However, as the duration of pivoting is small, and the vessel has sufficient momentum to prevent sticking at this stage, these high pressures are permissible.
[줄 738] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - At the after end of the cradle considerable packing may also be required, and again vertical timber props or plate brackets may be fitted to form the after poppet.
[줄 739] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Lubricant For the ship to start sliding on release of the holding arrangements, it is necessary for the ship to overcome the coefficient of friction of the launching lubricant.
[줄 740] [91.3%] (21/23) ✅ 유지 - To do this the slope of the ways under the vessel's center of gravity must exceed the lubricant's coefficient of friction.
[줄 741] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - An estimate of the frictional resistance of the grease must be made before building the ship, since the declivity of the keel is dependent to a large extent on the slope of the ways.
[줄 742] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Formerly, melted tallow was applied to the ways, allowed to harden, and then covered with a coat of soft soap.
[줄 743] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - Since the mid 1900s patent mineral-based greases have been applied to the ground ways, these greases being virtually unaffected by temperature changes and insoluble in water whilst adhering firmly to the ways.
[줄 744] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - A commercially marketed petroleum-based launching grease is applied over the mineral grease base coat.
[줄 745] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - This has a coefficient of friction that is low enough to allow initial starting and the maintenance of sliding until the initial resistance of the base coat is overcome by frictional heat.
[줄 746] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - To prevent the petroleum-based grease from soaking into the sliding ways, a base coat may be applied to them.
[줄 747] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Standing ways that extend into the water may be dried out at low tide prior to the launch and the base coat and grease applied.
[줄 748] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Releasing arrangements Small ships may be released by knocking away a diagonal dog-shore fitted between the sliding and standing ways.
[줄 749] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - In most cases, however, triggers are used to release the ship.
[줄 750] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - There are several types available, hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical-mechanical triggers having been used.
[줄 751] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Electrical-mechanical triggers are commonly used for rapid simultaneous release in modern practice.
[줄 752] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - The hydraulic trigger is less easily installed and less safe.
[줄 753] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - The electrical-mechanical trigger illustrated in Figure 15.3 is generally located near amidships and a small pit is provided in the berth to accommodate the falling levers.
[줄 754] [95.2%] (40/42) ✅ 유지 - A number of triggers will be fitted depending on the size of the vessel to be launched; in the case of the 75,000-tonne bulk carrier for which a launching sequence is given below, six triggers were fitted for the launch.
[줄 755] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - These triggers are in effect a simple system of levers that allow the large loads acting down the ways to be balanced by a small load on the releasing gear.
[줄 756] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - The principle is often compared with that of a simple mechanical reduction gearing.

[줄 760] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Simultaneous release of the triggers is achieved by means of catches held by solenoids wired in a common circuit.
[줄 761] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - These are released immediately the circuit current is reversed.
[줄 762] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - Launching sequence As a guide to the procedure leading up to the launch, the following example is given for the launch of a 75,000-tonne bulk carrier.
[줄 763] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The launch ways have been built up as the ship is erected from aft; the ways have been greased and the cradle erected.
[줄 764] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Four days before launch a start is made on ramming up the launch blocks, i.e driving in the wedges to raise ship off the building blocks.
[줄 765] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - This is done by a dozen or so men using a long ramming pole, a gang working either side of the ship.
[줄 766] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Two days before the launch a start is made on removing the shores.
[줄 767] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - On the morning of the launch everything is removed up to the high water mark and tumbler shores are put in aft.

[줄 770] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - An evenly distributed number of keel blocks are then taken out so that only about 20 keel blocks are left supporting the ship.
[줄 771] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Half an hour before the launch the last remaining keel blocks are removed.
[줄 772] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - The bilge blocks are then removed.
[줄 773] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The full ship's weight comes on the triggers at the time planned for the launch.
[줄 774] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - Release of triggers on launch by sponsor.
[줄 775] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - If the vessel fails to start under the action of gravity, the initial movement may be aided by hydraulic starting rams, which are provided at the head of the cradle.
[줄 776] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Arresting arrangements In many cases the extent of the water into which the ship is launched is restricted.
[줄 777] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - It is then necessary to provide means of arresting the motion of the ship once it is in the water.
[줄 778] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - There are a number of methods available for doing this, one or more being employed at most ship launches.
[줄 779] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The commonest arrangement is to use chain drags, which are generally arranged symmetrically on either side of the ship.
[줄 780] [100.0%] (42/42) ✅ 유지 - Each chain drag is laid in the form of a horseshoe with its rounded portion away from the water, so that as the ship moves down the ways the forward portion of the drag is pulled through the remainder of the pile.
[줄 781] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - This prevents any excessive shock load in the chain, which would occur if the pile of chain were to be suddenly accelerated to the speed of the ship.
[줄 782] [94.4%] (34/36) ✅ 유지 - The wire rope drag lines are attached to temporary pads on the side of the ship, and supported by rope tricing lines as they are led slightly forward and then aft along the ship's sides.
[줄 783] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Each drag line is then led forward and shackled to the chain drag.
[줄 784] [92.0%] (23/25) ✅ 유지 - As the ship is released and moves aft the tricing lines are broken in turn, the work done absorbing some of the ship's energy.
[줄 785] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - To further increase the resistance to motion of the ship, wooden masks may be fitted at the stern of the ship.
[줄 786] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The mask is made as large as possible but located low down to present a flat surface to the water in the direction of motion.
[줄 787] [100.0%] (3/3) ✅ 유지 - Masks are often

[줄 790] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - One or two shipyards are forced to provide arrangements for slewing the vessel once it has left the ways, as the river into which the ships are launched is very narrow in relation to the ship's length.
[줄 791] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Chain drags, weights, or anchors may be placed in the water to one side of the building berth for this purpose.
[줄 792] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - These are then made fast to the stern of the ship with drag lines of a predetermined length.
[줄 793] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Once the vessel is clear of the ways the slack of the lines is taken up and the stern swings so that the ship is pointing up river.
[줄 794] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Side launches Side launching is often used where the width of water available is considerably restricted.
[줄 795] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - There are in fact some advantages to this method, for example the absence of keel declivity, and the relatively simple cradle and short ground ways that do not extend into the water.
[줄 796] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - However, it means that a large area of waterfront is taken up by a single building berth, and the ship is only reasonably accessible from one side during construction.
[줄 797] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - Side launching is usually restricted to small ships, typically no more that around 100 meters in length.
[줄 798] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The ground ways are arranged transversely, i.e at right angles to the line of keel.
[줄 799] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Sliding ways can also be placed transversely with the packing above them forming the cradle, but they are generally arranged longitudinally.
[줄 800] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - In this case where they are parallel to the keel, the sliding ways are in groups covering two or three ground ways.
[줄 801] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Packing again forms the cradle with tie pieces between the groups of sliding ways.
[줄 802] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - One of the features of side launching is the drop where the ground ways are not extended into the water; consequently, large angles of heel occur when the vessel strikes the water.
[줄 803] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - As a result it is necessary to carry out careful stability calculations and close any openings before side launching a vessel.
[줄 804] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - It is true, of course, that stability calculations are also required for a conventional end launch.
[줄 805] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Building docks Perhaps the greatest advantage of the building dock is the relative simplicity of the task of getting the vessel waterborne.
[줄 806] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - When it is convenient the dock may be flooded and the vessel floated out.
[줄 807] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - In a building dock it is also possible to construct two ships at the same time.
[줄 808] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The second of two is usually at the landward end of the dock, and can be separated from the seaward end by an intermediate dock gate.
[줄 809] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The first ship can then be floated out of the dock while the second remains in the dry.
[줄 810] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Once the dock is dewatered the second ship can be moved to the seaward end and a third ship started.
[줄 811] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - This allows better utilization of the large and expensive cranes, and also allows double the time to complete the more outfit-intensive zones of the ship, usually the aft machinery spaces and accommodation.
[줄 812] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The dock also has a horizontal base, which simplifies alignment of structural units or blocks and management of the ship dimensions.
[줄 813] [97.2%] (35/36) ✅ 유지 - Calculations are needed to check the stability and loads exerted by the blocks during flooding, the whole problem being similar to that of undocking a vessel that has been dry-docked for survey or other reasons.
[줄 814] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - In some shipyards conventional berths are fitted at the river or sea end with what is virtually a pair of dock gates.
[줄 815] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - This can be of advantage when working the aft end of the ship and installing the ways.
[줄 816] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - In many instances it also permits higher tides over the way ends when the gates are opened for a launch.
[줄 817] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - A dock gate is ideal in tideless conditions, for example in the Baltic or Mediterranean Seas.
[줄 818] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The ship can be built with the gate closed, maintaining a dry working environment.
[줄 819] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - When the gate is opened the lower part of the slipway floods and provides sufficient water depth for the launch to be carried out successfully.
[줄 820] [100.0%] (47/47) ✅ 유지 - Whilst large ships may be extruded out of building halls on to a slipway and large sections transferred by similar means to the head of the slipway and raised onto it for joining and launching, smaller complete ships may be transferred to a ship lift for launching.
[줄 821] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Rail systems are incorporated into the building hall and lead out to the open ship lift.
[줄 822] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - The best known of these ship lift systems is the patented 'Syncrolift', originally used for slipping ships for repairs and surveys but now also used by some shipyards for launching new ships.
[줄 823] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Ship lifts basically consist of a series of transverse beams, each supported by wires or chains suspended from a winch on each side.
[줄 824] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - The beams have the transfer rails running longitudinally across them.
[줄 825] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - A platform is also supported by the beams to provide access when the ship is lifted clear of the water.
[줄 826] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - To launch, the ship is positioned on the structure, which can be lowered into the water and the ship floated off the platform.
[줄 827] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The lift can also be used to recover a ship from the water for repair.
[줄 828] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - The platform is raised and lowered mechanically or hydraulically and is usually provided with transfer arrangements so that the vessel can be moved on or off the platform either laterally or in line with the platform.
[줄 829] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Originally, ship lifts were used for fleets of small ships, for example in fishing ports, but have increased in size for large commercial repairs and some construction.
[줄 830] [81.8%] (9/11) ✅ 유지 - The largest lift is able to lift over 20,000 tonnes.
[줄 831] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Floating docks Occasionally, and usually as a temporary expedient, a ship can be built on the land and transferred to a floating dock for launching.
[줄 832] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The arrangement is similar to a ship lift, with rails to allow the completed ship to be transferred onto the dock.
[줄 833] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - The dock is then sunk in the location or may be towed to deeper water so the ship can be floated off.
[줄 834] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - As an alternative a ship may be transferred to a pontoon, in an operation similar to an offshore structure loadout.
[줄 835] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The pontoon will require some reserve buoyancy to maintain stability during the operation and this is usually provided by 'towers' at each corner.
[줄 836] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Such a specialized pontoon is less expensive than a conventional floating dock.
[줄 837] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Marine railways A few small shipyards use a slipway with a set or rails that extend into the water.
[줄 838] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - The ship is constructed on, or transferred to, a cradle that can run on the rails.
[줄 839] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - For launch, the cradle is lowered down the slipway until the ship floats off.
[줄 840] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The operation is under control, unlike a dynamic end launch where, once started, the ship cannot be stopped.
[줄 841] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - As with the ship lift, a marine railway can also be used to recover ships for repair.

[줄 850] [92.3%] (24/26) ✅ 유지 - Testing double-bottom compartments 184 Machinery seats 184 Originally, ships were constructed with single bottoms, liquid fuels and fresh water being contained within separately constructed tanks.
[줄 851] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - The double-bottom structure, which provides increased safety in the event of bottom shell damage, and also provides liquid tank space low down in the ship, evolved during the early part of the twentieth century.
[줄 852] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Today, only small vessels such as tugs, ferries, and cargo ships of less than 500 gross tonnage have a single-bottom construction.
[줄 853] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Larger ocean-going vessels are fitted with some form of double bottom.
[줄 854] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Keels At the center line of the bottom structure is located the keel, which is often said to form the backbone of the ship.
[줄 855] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - This contributes substantially to the longitudinal strength and effectively distributes local loading caused when docking the ship.
[줄 856] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The commonest form of keel is that known as the 'flat plate' keel, and this is fitted in the majority of ocean-going and other vessels.
[줄 857] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the bar keel.
[줄 858] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The bar keel may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, etc and is also found in smaller ferries.
[줄 859] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - Where grounding is possible this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity.
[줄 860] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - If a double bottom is fitted the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, and bar keels are more often associated with open floors, but a flat plate keel can be fitted in way of open floors.

[줄 870] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The piping is then accessible when cargo is loaded, an entrance to the duct being provided at the forward end of the engine room.
[줄 871] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - No duct is required aft of the engine room as the piping may be carried in the shaft tunnel.
[줄 872] [87.9%] (29/33) ✅ 유지 - Awidth of not more than 2.0 m is allowed for the duct, and strengthening is provided at the tank top and keel plate to maintain continuity of strength of the transverse floors.

[줄 874] [88.7%] (55/62) ✅ 유지 - A center-line girder is fitted and one side girder is fitted each side of the center line where the beam is less than 10 m Where the beam is between 10 and 17 m, two side girders are fitted and if any bottom shell panel has a width-to-length ratio greater than 4 additional continuous or intercostal stiffeners are fitted.
[줄 875] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - The continuous center and intercostal side girders are stiffened at their upper edge and extend as far forward and aft as possible.
[줄 876] [87.1%] (27/31) ✅ 유지 - The single-bottom structure is shown in Figure 16.2 and for clarity a threedimensional representation of the structure is also provided to illustrate those members that are continuous or intercostal.
[줄 877] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Both single and double bottoms have continuous and intercostal material, and there is often some confusion in the student's mind as to what is implied by these terms.
[줄 878] [97.1%] (34/35) ✅ 유지 - Awood ceiling may be fitted across the top of the floors if cargoes are to be carried, but this does not constitute an inner bottom offering any protection if the outer bottom shell is damaged.
[줄 879] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Double-bottom structure An inner bottom may be provided at a minimum height above the bottom shell, and maintained watertight to the bilges.
[줄 880] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - This provides a considerable margin of safety, since in the event of bottom shell damage only the double-bottom space may be flooded.
[줄 881] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The space is not wasted but utilized to carry oil fuel and fresh water required for the ship, as well as providing ballast capacity.
[줄 882] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - The minimum depth of the double bottom in a ship will depend on the classification society's requirement for the depth of center girder.
[줄 883] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - It may be deeper to give the required capacities of oil fuel, fresh water, and water ballast to be carried in the bottom.
[줄 884] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Water-ballast bottom tanks are commonly provided right forward and aft for trimming purposes and if necessary the depth of the double bottom may be increased in these regions.
[줄 885] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - In way of the machinery spaces the double-bottom depth is also increased to provide appreciable capacities of lubricating oil and fuel oil.
[줄 886] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The increase in height of the inner bottom is always by a gradual taper in the longitudinal direction, no sudden discontinuities in the structure being tolerated.

[줄 889] [88.0%] (22/25) ✅ 유지 - Double bottoms may be framed longitudinally or transversely, but where the ship's length exceeds 120 m it is considered desirable to adopt longitudinal framing.
[줄 890] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - The explanation for this is that on longer ships tests and experience have shown that there is a tendency for the inner bottom and bottom shell to buckle if welded transverse framing is adopted.
[줄 891] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - This buckling occurs as a result of the longitudinal bending of the hull, and may be avoided by having the plating longitudinally stiffened.

[줄 896] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - It is not uncommon, however, for it to be extended to the ship's side, and individual bilge wells are then provided for drainage purposes.
[줄 897] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - In vessels requiring a passenger certificate it is a statutory requirement for the tank top to extend to the ship's side.
[줄 898] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - This provides a greater degree of safety, since there is a substantial area of bilge that may be damaged without flooding spaces above the inner bottom.
[줄 899] [97.1%] (34/35) ✅ 유지 - At the center line of the ship the middle strake of the inner bottom may be considered as the upper flange of the center-line docking girder, formed by the center girder and keel plate.

[줄 901] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Normally, a wood ceiling is provided under a hatchway in a general cargo ship, but the inner bottom plating thickness can be increased and the ceiling omitted.
[줄 902] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - If grabs are used for discharging from general cargo ships the plate thickness is further increased, or a double ceiling is fitted.
[줄 903] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Floors Vertical transverse plate floors are provided both where the bottom is transversely and longitudinally framed.
[줄 904] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - At the ends of bottom tank spaces and under the main bulkheads, watertight or oiltight plate floors are provided.
[줄 905] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - These are made watertight or oiltight by closing any holes in the plate floor and welding collars around any members that pass through the floors.
[줄 906] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Elsewhere, 'solid plate floors' are fitted to strengthen the bottom transversely and support the inner bottom.
[줄 907] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - These run transversely from the continuous center girder to the bilge, and manholes provided for access through the tanks and lightening holes are cut in each solid plate floor.
[줄 908] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Also, small air and drain holes may be drilled at the top and bottom respectively of the solid plate floors in the tank spaces.
[줄 909] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The spacing of the solid plate floors varies according to the loads supported and local stresses experienced.
[줄 910] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - At intermediate frame spaces between the solid plate floors, 'bracket floors' are fitted.
[줄 911] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - The bracket floor consists simply of short transverse plate brackets fitted in way of the center girder and tank sides.
[줄 912] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Transversely framed double bottom If the double bottom is transversely framed, then transverse solid plate floors, and bracket floors with transverse frames, provide the principal support for the inner bottom and bottom shell plating.

[줄 1072] [94.3%] (33/35) ✅ 유지 - A main ice belt zone is defined that extends above the ice load waterline i.e normally the summer load waterline and below the ice light waterline i.e lightest waterline ship navigates ice in.
[줄 1073] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - The extent of this zone depends on the ice class assigned.
[줄 1074] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - The shell plating thickness in this zone is greater than on a conventional ship and increases with severity of ice class and with position from aft to forward.
[줄 1075] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - For the more severe ice conditions the thickness of the side shell is also increased below the main ice belt zone for at least 40% of the length from forward.
[줄 1076] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - Transverse main and intermediate frames of heavier scantlings are fitted in way of the main ice belt zone.
[줄 1077] [89.5%] (17/19) ✅ 유지 - Where the shell is longitudinally framed, longitudinals of increased scantlings are fitted in way of the ice belt zone.
[줄 1078] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Both transverse and longitudinal frame scantling requirements are dependent on the severity of ice class assigned and distance of frame from forward.
[줄 1079] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Transverse ice framing is supported by ice stringers and decks, and longitudinal framing by web frames, the scantlings of which are increased with severity of ice class and distance from forward.

[줄 1081] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Bilge keel Most ships are fitted with some form of bilge keel, the prime function of which is to help damp the rolling motion of the vessel.
[줄 1082] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Other relatively minor advantages of the bilge keel are protection for the bilge on grounding, and increased longitudinal strength at the bilge.
[줄 1083] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The damping action provided by the bilge keel is relatively small but effective, and virtually without cost after the construction of the ship.
[줄 1084] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - It is carefully positioned on the ship so as to avoid excessive drag when the ship is under way, and to achieve a minimum drag, various positions of the bilge keel may be tested on the ship model used to predict power requirements.
[줄 1085] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - This bilge keel then generally runs over the midship portion of the hull, often extending further aft than forward of amidships and being virtually perpendicular to the turn of the bilge.
[줄 1086] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - There are many forms of bilge keel construction, and some quite elaborate arrangements have been adopted in an attempt to improve the damping performance whilst reducing any drag.
[줄 1087] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - Care is required in the design of the bilge keel, for although it would not be considered as a critical strength member of the hull structure, the region of its attachment is fairly highly stressed owing to its distance from the neutral axis.
[줄 1088] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Cracks have originated in the bilge keel and propagated into the bilge plate causing failure of the main structure.

[줄 1091] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - This resulted in the awning or spar deck type of ship, the temporary enclosed spaces being exempt from tonnage measurement since they were not permanently closed spaces.
[줄 1092] [97.3%] (36/37) ✅ 유지 - These awning or spar deck structures eventually became an integral part of the ship structure but retained a lighter structure than the upper deck structure of other two-deck ships, later referred to as 'full scantling' vessels.
[줄 1093] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - The 'shelter deck type', as this form of vessel became known, apart from having a lighter upper structure was to have the freeboard measured from the second deck, and the tween deck space was exempt from tonnage measurement.
[줄 1094] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - This exemption was obtained by the provision of openings in the shelter deck and tween deck bulkheads complying with certain statutory regulations.
[줄 1095] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - At a later date, what were known as open/closed shelter deck ships were developed.
[줄 1096] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - These were full scantling ships having the prescribed openings so that the tween deck was exempt from tonnage measurement when the vessel was operating at a load draft where the freeboard was measured from the second deck.
[줄 1097] [97.6%] (41/42) ✅ 유지 - It was possible to close permanently these temporary openings and reassign the freeboard, it then being measured from the upper deck so that the vessel might load to a deeper draft, and the tween deck was no longer exempt from tonnage measurement.
[줄 1098] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Open shelter deck vessels were popular with shipowners for a long period.
[줄 1099] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - However, during that time much consideration was given to their safety and the undesirable form of temporary openings in the main hull structure.
[줄 1100] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Eliminating these openings without substantially altering the tonnage values was the object of much discussion and deliberation.
[줄 1101] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Finally, Tonnage Regulations introduced in 1966 provided for the assignment of a tonnage mark, at a stipulated distance below the second deck.
[줄 1102] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - A vessel having a 'modified tonnage' had tonnage measured to the second deck only, i.e the tween deck was exempt, but the tonnage mark was not to be submerged.
[줄 1103] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Where a vessel was assigned 'alternative tonnages', tonnage was taken as that to the second deck when the tonnage mark was not submerged.
[줄 1104] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - When the tonnage mark was submerged, tonnage was taken as that to the upper deck, the freeboard being a minimum measured from the upper deck.
[줄 1105] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - The tonnage mark concept effectively dispensed with the undesirable tonnage openings.
[줄 1106] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - Further changes to tonnage requirements in 1969 led to the universal system of tonnage measurement without the need for tonnage marks, although older ships did retain their original tonnages up until 1994.
[줄 1107] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - Originally the machinery position was amidships with paddle wheel propulsion.
[줄 1108] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Also, with coal being burnt as the propulsive fuel, bunkers were then favorably placed amidships for trim purposes.
[줄 1109] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - With the use of oil fuel this problem was more or less overcome, and with screw propulsion there are definite advantages in having the machinery aft.
[줄 1110] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Taking the machinery right aft can produce an excessive trim by the stern in the light condition and the vessel is then provided with deep tanks forward.
[줄 1111] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - This may lead to a large bending moment in the ballast condition, and a compromise is often reached by placing the machinery three-quarters aft.
[줄 1112] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - That is, there are say three or four holds forward and one aft of the machinery space.
[줄 1113] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - In either arrangement the amidships portion with its better stowage shape is reserved for cargo, and shaft spaces lost to cargo are reduced.

[줄 1116] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Direct connection between the ground bar butt welds and the bilge plate and bilge keel butt welds and the ground bar are avoided.
[줄 1117] [81.8%] (18/22) ✅ 유지 - In ships over 65 m in length, holes are drilled in the bilge keel butt welds as shown in Figure 17.5.
[줄 1118] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - The ground bar thickness is at least that of the bilge plate or 14 mm, whichever is the lesser, and the material grade is the same as that of the bilge plate.
[줄 1119] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Connection of the ground bar to the shell is by continuous fillet welds and the bilge keel is connected to the ground bar by light continuous or staggered intermittent weld.
[줄 1120] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The latter lighter weld ensures that should the bilge keel be fouled, failure occurs at this joint without the bilge plate being damaged.

[줄 1144] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - This chapter deals with the internal vertical structure of the ship.
[줄 1145] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Much of this structure, particularly the pillars and to some extent the transverse strength bulkheads, is responsible for carrying the vertical loading experienced by the ship.
[줄 1146] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The principal bulkheads subdivide the ship hull into a number of large watertight compartments, and their construction and spacing is discussed.
[줄 1147] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Also considered are the boundaries of other smaller compartments, such as deep tanks and the shaft tunnel.
[줄 1148] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Bulkheads Vertical partitions in a ship arranged transversely or fore and aft are referred to as 'bulkheads'.
[줄 1149] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Those bulkheads that are of greatest importance are the main hull transverse and longitudinal bulkheads, dividing the ship into a number of watertight compartments.
[줄 1150] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Other lighter bulkheads, named 'minor bulkheads', which act as screens further subdividing compartments into small units of accommodation or stores, are of little structural importance.
[줄 1151] [100.0%] (3/3) ✅ 유지 - All rights reserved.
[줄 1152] [97.1%] (33/34) ✅ 유지 - The main hull bulkheads of sufficient strength are made watertight in order that they may contain any flooding in the event of a compartment on one side of the bulkhead being bilged or breached.
[줄 1153] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - Further, they serve as a hull strength member, not only carrying some of the ship's vertical loading but also resisting any tendency for transverse deformation of the ship.
[줄 1154] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - As a rule the strength of the transverse watertight bulkheads is maintained to the strength deck, which may be above the freeboard deck.
[줄 1155] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Finally, each of the main hull bulkheads has often proved a very effective barrier to the spread of a hold or machinery space fire.
[줄 1156] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Spacing of watertight bulkheads cargo ships The minimum number of transverse watertight bulkheads that must be fitted in a dry cargo ship are stipulated.
[줄 1157] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - A collision bulkhead must be fitted forward, an aft peak bulkhead must be fitted, and watertight bulkheads must be provided at either end of the machinery space.
[줄 1158] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - This implies that for a vessel with machinery amidships the minimum possible number of watertight bulkheads is four.
[줄 1159] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - With the machinery aft this minimum number may be reduced to three, the aft peak bulkhead being at the aft end of the machinery space.
[줄 1160] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Of these bulkheads, perhaps the most important is the collision bulkhead forward.
[줄 1161] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - It is a fact that the bow of at least one out of two ships involved in a collision will be damaged.
[줄 1162] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - For this reason a heavy bulkhead is specified and located so that it is not so far forward as to be damaged on impact.
[줄 1163] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Neither should it be too far aft so that the compartment flooded forward causes excessive trim by the bow.
[줄 1164] [86.5%] (32/37) ✅ 유지 - Classification societies require the location for ships whose length does not exceed 200 m as not less than 5% and not greater than 8% of the ship's length from the fore end of the load waterline.
[줄 1165] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - A minimum distance of 10 meters may also be specified to ensure that the bulkhead is effective.
[줄 1166] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - As a rule this bulkhead is fitted at the minimum distance in order to gain the maximum length for cargo stowage.
[줄 1167] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The aft peak bulkhead is intended to enclose the stern tubes in a watertight compartment, preventing any emergency from leakage where the propeller shafts pierce the hull.
[줄 1168] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - It is located well aft so that the peak when flooded would not cause excessive trim by the stern.
[줄 1169] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Machinery bulkheads provide a selfcontained compartment for engines and boilers, preventing damage to these vital components of the ship by flooding in an adjacent hold.
[줄 1170] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - They also localize any fire originating in these spaces.
[줄 1171] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - A minimum number of watertight bulkheads will only be found in smaller cargo ships.
[줄 1172] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - As the size increases the classification society will recommend additional bulkheads, partly to provide greater transverse strength, and also to increase the amount of subdivision.
[줄 1173] [83.3%] (15/18) ✅ 유지 - Table 18.1 indicates the number of watertight bulkheads recommended by Lloyd's Register for any cargo ship.
[줄 1174] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - These should be spaced at uniform intervals, but the shipowner may require for a certain trade a longer hold, which is permitted if additional approved transverse stiffening is provided.
[줄 1175] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - It is possible to dispense with one watertight bulkhead altogether, with Lloyd's Register approval, if adequate approved structural compensation is introduced.
[줄 1176] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - In container ships the spacing is arranged to suit the standard length of containers carried.
[줄 1177] [97.7%] (42/43) ✅ 유지 - By the mid 1970s many of the cargo liner trades had been taken over by the container ship and much of the short haul trade undertaken by the conventional dry cargo ship had passed to the 'roll-on roll-off' type of vessel.
[줄 1178] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Container ships A feature of the container ship is the stowage of the rectangular container units within the fuller rectangular portion of the hull and their arrangement in tiers above the main deck level.
[줄 1179] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - In order to facilitate removal and placing of the container units of internationally agreed standard dimensions hold and hatch widths are common.
[줄 1180] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The narrow deck width outboard of the hatch opening forms the crown of a double shell space containing wing ballast tanks and passageways.
[줄 1181] [92.9%] (13/14) ✅ 유지 - Later container ship designs feature hatchless vessels that provide a faster turnaround in port.
[줄 1182] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - These may have hatch covers on the forward holds only, or none at all, and are provided with substantial stripping pumps for removing rain and green water from the holds.
[줄 1183] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - In recent years the size of container ships making oceanic voyages has substantially increased.
[줄 1184] [75.0%] (12/16) ✅ 유지 - The largest ships are those operated by Maersk, which can carry a reported 13,500 TEU.
[줄 1185] [87.5%] (21/24) ✅ 유지 - These are unusual and most large ships are between with one classification society reporting more than 60 vessels of at least 8000 TEU classed.
[줄 1186] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - Barge-carrying ships Another development in the cargo liner trade was the introduction of the bargecarrying vessel.
[줄 1187] [100.0%] (40/40) ✅ 유지 - An early version of this type of ship had a particular advantage in maintaining a scheduled service between the ports at mouths of large river systems such as between the Mississippi river in the USA and the Rhine in Europe.
[줄 1188] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Standard unit cargo barges are carried on board ship and placed overboard or lifted onboard at terminal ports by large deck-mounted gantries or elevator platforms in association with traveling rails.
[줄 1189] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Other designs make provision for floating the barges in and out of the carrying ship, which can be ballasted to accommodate them.
[줄 1190] [97.3%] (36/37) ✅ 유지 - This development appears not to have been as successful as was initially envisaged in the late 1970s, and whilst the merits of this type of craft are still often referred to, the type is now rarely seen.
[줄 1191] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - Ro-ro ships These ships are characterized by the stern and in some cases the bow or side doors giving access to a vehicle deck above the waterline but below the upper deck.
[줄 1192] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Access within the ship may be provided in the form of ramps or lifts leading from this vehicle deck to upper decks or hold below.
[줄 1193] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - Ro-ro ships may be fitted with various patent ramps for loading through the shell doors when not trading to regular ports where link span and other shore-side facilities that are designed to suit are available.
[줄 1194] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Cargo is carried in vehicles and trailers or in unitized form loaded by fork-lift and other trucks.
[줄 1195] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - In order to permit the drive-through vehicle deck
[줄 1196] [97.1%] (34/35) ✅ 유지 - Each of the main watertight hold bulkheads may extend to the uppermost continuous deck, but in the case where the freeboard is measured from the second deck they need only be taken to that deck.
[줄 1197] [100.0%] (38/38) ✅ 유지 - The collision bulkhead extends to the uppermost continuous deck and the aft peak bulkhead may terminate at the first deck above the load waterline provided this is made watertight to the stern, or to a watertight transom floor.
[줄 1198] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - In the case of bulk carriers a further consideration may come into the spacing of the watertight bulkheads where a shipowner desires to obtain a reduced freeboard.
[줄 1199] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - It is possible with bulk carriers to obtain a reduced freeboard under The International Load Line Convention 1966 if it is possible to flood one or more compartments without loss of the vessel.
[줄 1200] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - For obvious reasons many shipowners will wish to obtain the maximum permissible draft for this type of vessel and the bulkhead spacing will be critical.
[줄 1201] [89.5%] (51/57) ✅ 유지 - Additionally, SOLAS amendments now require that bulk carriers constructed after 1 July 1999 and of 150 meters or more in length of singleside skin construction and designed to carry solid bulk cargoes of 1000 kg/cubic meter or more when loaded to the summer load line must be able to withstand flooding of any one cargo hold.

[줄 1203] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Under this convention the subdivision of the passenger ship is strictly specified, and controlled by the authorities of the maritime countries who are signatories to the convention.
[줄 1204] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - In the United Kingdom the controlling authority is the Marine and Coastguard Agency.
[줄 1205] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Construction of watertight bulkheads The plating of a flat transverse bulkhead is generally welded in horizontal strakes, and convenient two-dimensional units for prefabrication are formed.
[줄 1206] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Smaller bulkheads may be erected as a single unit; larger bulkheads are in two or more units.
[줄 1207] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - always been the practice to use horizontal strakes of plating since the plate thickness increases with depth below the top of the bulkhead.
[줄 1208] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The reason for this is that the plate thickness is directly related to the pressure exerted by the head of water when a compartment on one side of the bulkhead is flooded.
[줄 1209] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Apart from the depth, the plate thickness is also influenced by the supporting stiffener spacing.
[줄 1210] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Vertical stiffeners are fitted to the transverse watertight bulkheads of a ship, the span being less in this direction and the stiffener therefore having less tendency to deflect under load.
[줄 1211] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Stiffening is usually in the form of welded inverted ordinary angle bars, or offset bulb plates, the size of the stiffener being dependent on the unsupported length, stiffener spacing, and rigidity of the end connections.
[줄 1212] [100.0%] (41/41) ✅ 유지 - Rigidity of the end connections will depend on the form of end connection, stiffeners in holds being bracketed or simply directly welded to the tank top or underside of deck, whilst upper tween stiffeners need not have any connection at all.
[줄 1213] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Vertical stiffeners may be supported by horizontal stringers, permitting a reduction in the stiffener scantling as a result of the reduced span.
[줄 1214] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Horizontal stringers are mostly found on those bulkheads forming the boundaries of a tank space, and in this context are dealt with later.
[줄 1215] [95.7%] (44/46) ✅ 유지 - It is not uncommon to find in present-day ships swedged and corrugated bulkheads, the swedges like the troughs of a corrugated bulkhead being so designed and spaced as to provide sufficient rigidity to the plate bulkhead in order that conventional stiffeners may be dispensed with.
[줄 1216] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Both swedges and corrugations are arranged in the vertical direction like the stiffeners on transverse and short longitudinal pillar bulkheads.
[줄 1217] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Since the plating is swedged or corrugated prior to its fabrication, the bulkhead will be plated vertically with a uniform thickness equivalent to that required at the base of the bulkhead.
[줄 1218] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - This implies that the actual plating will be somewhat heavier than that for a conventional bulkhead, and this will to a large extent offset any saving in weight gained by not fitting stiffeners.
[줄 1219] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - At the lower end of transverse hold bulkheads in bulk carriers a bulkhead stool is generally fitted at the lower end of the bulkhead.

[줄 1221] [93.3%] (14/15) ✅ 유지 - Inclined shedder plates or gussets are also fitted between the corrugations directly above the stool.
[줄 1222] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - The addition of a vertical plate bracket under the inclined shedder plate at the midpoint of the corrugation stiffens and supports the corrugation against collapse under load.

[줄 1226] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The deck is lap welded to the shelf plate with an overlap of about 25 mm.
[줄 1227] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - In the case of a corrugated bulkhead it becomes necessary to fit filling pieces between the troughs in way of the shelf plate.
[줄 1228] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - If possible the passage of piping and ventilation trunks through watertight bulkheads is avoided.

[줄 1244] [94.1%] (32/34) ✅ 유지 - If the stiffener spacing is increased to accommodate the opening, the scantlings of the stiffeners on either side of the opening are increased to give an equivalent strength to that of an unpierced bulkhead.
[줄 1245] [88.5%] (23/26) ✅ 유지 - The actual opening is kept as small as possible, the access to the shaft tunnel being about 1000–1250 mm high and about 700 mm wide.

[줄 1255] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - The horizontal sliding door may also be opened and closed by a hydraulic ram with a hydraulic hand pump and with control at the door and above the bulkhead deck.
[줄 1256] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - With the larger number of watertight doors fitted in passenger ships the doors may be closed by means of hydraulic power actuated by remote control from a central position above the bulkhead deck.
[줄 1257] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - When in place all watertight doors are given a hose test, but those in a passenger ship are required to be tested under a head of water extending to the bulkhead deck.

[줄 1259] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - In approved positions in the upper tween decks well above the waterline, hinged watertight doors are permitted.
[줄 1260] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - These may be similar to the weathertight doors fitted in superstructures, but are to have gunmetal pins in the hinges.
[줄 1261] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Deep tanks Deep tanks were often fitted adjacent to the machinery spaces amidships to provide ballast capacity, improving the draft with little trim,when the ship was light.

[줄 1268] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Most ships now have their machinery arranged aft or occasionally three-quarters aft, and are fitted with deep tanks forward to improve the trim in the light conditions.
[줄 1269] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Construction of deep tanks Bulkheads that form the boundaries of a deep tank differ from hold bulkheads in that they are regularly subjected to pressure from a head of liquid.
[줄 1270] [100.0%] (50/50) ✅ 유지 - The conventional hold bulkhead may be allowed to deflect and tolerate high stresses on the rare occasions when it has to withstand temporary flooding of a hold, but deep tank bulkheads, which are regularly loaded in this manner, are required to have greater rigidity and be subject to lower stresses.
[줄 1271] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - As a result the plate and stiffener scantlings will be larger in way of deep tanks, and additional stiffening may be introduced.
[줄 1272] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The greater plating thickness of the tank boundary bulkheads increases with tank depth, and with increasing stiffener spacing.
[줄 1273] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - To provide the greater rigidity the vertical stiffeners are of heavier scantlings and more closely spaced.
[줄 1274] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - They must be bracketed or welded to some other form of stiffening member at their ends.
[줄 1275] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Vertical stiffener sizes may be reduced, however, by fitting horizontal girders that form a continuous line of support on the bulkheads and ship's side.
[줄 1276] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - These horizontal girders are connected at their ends by flanged brackets and are supported by tripping brackets at the toes of the end brackets, and at every third stiffener or frame.
[줄 1277] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Intermediate frames and stiffeners are effectively connected to the horizontal girders.
[줄 1278] [97.7%] (43/44) ✅ 유지 - Where deep tanks are intended to carry oil fuel for the ship's use, or oil cargoes, there will be a free surface, and it is necessary to fit a center-line bulkhead where the tanks extend from side to side of the ship.
[줄 1279] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - This is to reduce the free surface effect.
[줄 1280] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - The center-line bulkhead may be intact or perforated, and where intact the scantlings will be the same as for boundary bulkheads.
[줄 1281] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - If perforated, the area of perforations is sufficient to reduce liquid pressures, and the bulkhead stiffeners have considerably reduced scantlings, surging being avoided by limiting the perforation area.
[줄 1282] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Both swedged and corrugated plating can be used to advantage in the construction of deep tanks since, without the conventional stiffening, tanks are more easily cleaned.
[줄 1283] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - However, the use of corrugations does cause problems in ship construction.
[줄 1284] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - With conventional welded stiffening it may be convenient to arrange the stiffeners outside the tank so that the boundary bulkhead has a plain inside for ease of cleaning.
[줄 1285] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - In cargo ships where various liquid cargoes are carried, arrangements may be made to fit cofferdams between deep tanks.
[줄 1286] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - As these tanks may also be fitted immediately forward of the machine space, a pipe tunnel is generally fitted through them with access from the engine room.
[줄 1287] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This tunnel carries the bilge piping as it is undesirable to pass this through the deep tanks carrying oil cargoes.
[줄 1288] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - Testing deep tanks Deep tanks are tested by subjecting them to the maximum head of water to which they might be subject in service i.e to the top of the air pipe.

[줄 1295] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - In present practice, as indicated in Chapter 17, the topside tank is generally stiffened internally by longitudinal framing supported by transverses.
[줄 1296] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - Transverses are arranged in line with the end of the main cargo hatchways, and in large ships a fore and aft diaphragm may be fitted at half the width of the tank, between the deck and the sloping plating.
[줄 1297] [97.4%] (38/39) ✅ 유지 - Shaft tunnel When the ship's machinery is not located fully aft it is necessary to enclose the propeller shaft or shafts in a watertight tunnel between the aft end of the machinery space and the aft peak bulkhead.
[줄 1298] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - This protects the shaft from the cargo and provides a watertight compartment that will contain any flooding resulting from damage to the watertight gland at the aft peak bulkhead.

[줄 1304] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Shaft tunnels also provide a convenient means of carrying piping aft, which is then accessible and protected from cargo damage.
[줄 1305] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Construction of the shaft tunnel The thickness of the tunnel plating is determined in the same manner as that for the watertight bulkheads.
[줄 1306] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Where the top of the tunnel is well rounded the thickness of the top plating may be reduced, but where the top is flat it is increased.
[줄 1307] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Under hatchways the top plating must be increased in thickness unless it is covered by wood of a specified thickness.

[줄 1333] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - Pillars The prime function of the pillars is to carry the load of the decks and weights upon the decks vertically down to the ship's bottom structure where these loads are supported by the upward buoyant forces.
[줄 1334] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - A secondary function of pillars is to tie together the structure in a vertical direction.
[줄 1335] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Within the main hull of a cargo ship two different forms of pillar may be found, those in the holds invariably fulfilling the first function and those in the machinery spaces fulfilling the latter function.
[줄 1336] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Hold pillars, primarily in compression, are often without bracket connections at their ends, whilst machinery space pillars are heavily bracketed at their ends to permit tensile loadings.
[줄 1337] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - This latter type of pillar may also be found in tank spaces where the crown of tank under pressure can put the pillar in tension.
[줄 1338] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Spacing of hold pillars Since pillars located in holds will interfere with the stowage arrangements, widely spaced pillars of large fabricated section are used rather than small, solid, closely spaced pillar systems.

[줄 1372] [97.5%] (39/40) ✅ 유지 - Watertight decks are fitted to maintain the integrity of the main watertight hull, and the most important is the freeboard deck, which is the uppermost deck having permanent means of closing all openings in the exposed portions of that deck.
[줄 1373] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Although all decks contribute to some extent to the strength of the ship, the most important is that which forms the upper flange of the main hull girder, called the 'strength deck'.
[줄 1374] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Lighter decks that are not watertight may be fitted to provide platforms for passenger accommodation and permit more flexible cargo-loading arrangements.
[줄 1375] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - In general cargo ships these lighter decks form tweens that provide spaces in which goods may be stowed without their being crushed by a large amount of other cargo stowed above them.
[줄 1376] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - To permit loading and discharging of cargo, openings must be cut in the decks, and these may be closed by nonwatertight or watertight hatches.
[줄 1377] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - Other openings are required for personal access through the decks, and in way of the machinery space casing openings are provided that allow the removal of machinery items when necessary, and also provide light and air to this space.

[줄 1383] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - The camber may be parabolic or straight,the latter being preferred in many cases to allow panel lines to be used for the production of the deck panels.
[줄 1384] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - There may be advantages in fitting horizontal decks in some ships, particularly if containers are carried and regular cross-sections are desired.
[줄 1385] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Short lengths of internal deck or flats are as a rule horizontal.

[줄 1389] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Plating that lies within the line of the hatch openings contributes little to the longitudinal strength of the deck and it is therefore appreciably lighter.
[줄 1390] [94.9%] (37/39) ✅ 유지 - As the greatest longitudinal bending stresses will occur over the midship region, the greatest deck plate thickness is maintained over 40% of the length amidships, and it tapers to a minimum thickness permitted at the ends of the ship.
[줄 1391] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Locally, the plating thickness may be increased where higher stresses occur owing to discontinuities in the structure or concentrated loads.
[줄 1392] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Other thickness increases may occur where large deck loads are carried, where fork-lift trucks or other wheeled vehicles are to be used, and in way of deep tanks.
[줄 1393] [90.9%] (40/44) ✅ 유지 - Where the strength deck plating exceeds 30 mm it is to be Grade B steel and if it exceeds 40 mm Grade D over the midships region, at the ends of the superstructure, and in way of the cargo hold region in container ships.

[줄 1406] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Deck stiffening Decks may be framed transversely or longitudinally, but outside the line of openings it is preferred that longitudinal framing should be adopted for the strength deck.
[줄 1407] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - When the decks are longitudinally framed the scantlings of the longitudinals are dependent on their spacing, the length of ship, whether they are inside or outside the line of hatch openings, their span, and the deck loading.
[줄 1408] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Deck transverses support the longitudinals, and these are built from a deep web plate with flange or welded face flat, and are bracketed to the side frame.
[줄 1409] [91.1%] (41/45) ✅ 유지 - Within the forward 7.5% of the ship's length, the forecastle and weather deck transverses are closely spaced and the longitudinal scantlings increased, the additional transverse and longitudinal stiffening forward being designed to avoid buckling of the deck plating on impact when shipping seas.
[줄 1410] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Transversely framed decks are fitted with deck beams at every frame, and these have scantlings that are dependent on their span, spacing, and location in the ship.
[줄 1411] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Those fitted right forward on weather decks, like the longitudinal framing forward, have heavier scantlings, and the frame spacing is also decreased in this region so they will be closer together.
[줄 1412] [97.1%] (33/34) ✅ 유지 - Beams fitted in way of deep tanks, peak tanks, and oil bunkers may also have increased scantlings as they are required to have the same rigidity as the stiffeners of the tank boundary bulkheads.
[줄 1413] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Deck beams are supported by longitudinal deck girders that have similar scantlings to deck transverses fitted with any longitudinal framing.
[줄 1414] [87.0%] (20/23) ✅ 유지 - Within the forward 7.5% of the ship's length these deck girders are more closely spaced on the forecastle and weather decks.

[줄 1419] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - At the ends of the hatches heavy transverse beams are fitted and these may be connected at the intersection with the hatch side girder by horizontal gusset plates.
[줄 1420] [90.9%] (20/22) ✅ 유지 - Where the deck plating extends inside the coamings of hatches amidships the side coaming is extended in the form of tapered brackets.
[줄 1421] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Hatches The basic regulations covering the construction and means of closing hatches in weathertight decks are contained within the Conditions of Assignment of Freeboard of the Load Line Convention.
[줄 1422] [91.7%] (22/24) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's Register provides formulae for determining the minimum scantlings of steel covers, which will be within the requirements of the Load Line Convention.

[줄 1425] [87.8%] (36/41) ✅ 유지 - The dramatic loss of the ro-ro passenger ships Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 and Estonia in 1994 saw much attention directed at the damage stability of this type of passenger ship when water entered the open unsubdivided deck space.
[줄 1426] [97.2%] (35/36) ✅ 유지 - This has resulted in international regulation requiring, amongst other things, strengthening and surveillance of bow doors, surveillance of internal watertight doors used at sea, enhanced damage stability criteria and additional simplified stability information for the master.
[줄 1427] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The Estonia loss led to further stringent damage stability requirements adopted on a regional basis by northern European countries.
[줄 1428] [80.0%] (20/25) ✅ 유지 - A midship section of a ro-ro passenger/vehicle/train ferry complying with the requirements of the latter agreement is shown in Figure 17.10.
[줄 1429] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - Hull form Between the 1940s and 1970 there was a steady increase in the speed of the dry cargo ship and this was reflected in the hull form of the vessels.
[줄 1430] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - A much finer hull is apparent in modern vessels, particularly in those ships engaged in the longer cargo liner trades.
[줄 1431] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Bulbous bow forms and open water sterns are used to advantage and considerable flare may be seen in the bows of container ships to reduce wetness on deck where containers are stowed.
[줄 1432] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - In some early container ships it is thought that this was probably overdone, leading to an undesirable tendency for the main hull to whip during periods when the bows pitched into head seas.
[줄 1433] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Larger container ships may have the house three-quarters aft with the full beam maintained right to the stern to give the largest possible container capacity.
[줄 1434] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - Cargo handling equipment Cargo handling equipment, which remained relatively unchanged for a long period, has received considerable attention since the 1960s.
[줄 1435] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - This was primarily brought about by an awareness of the loss of revenue caused by the long periods of time thevessel may spend in port discharging and loading cargoes.
[줄 1436] [97.2%] (35/36) ✅ 유지 - Conventional cargo ships are now fitted with steel folding and/or rolling steel hatch covers of one patent type or another or liftable slab covers of steel, which reduce maintenance as well as speed cargo handling.
[줄 1437] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Various new lifting devices, derrick forms, and winches have been designed and introduced with marine shipborne cranes now almost completely replacing rigged derrick installations on modern ships.

[줄 1483] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Various other forms of cover are marketed, and tween deck steel covers are available to be fitted flush with the deck, which is essential nowadays when stowing cargoes in the tweens.
[줄 1484] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - To obtain weathertightness the patent covers have mating boundaries fitted with rubber gaskets; likewise at the hatch coamings, gaskets are fitted and hand or automatically operated cleats are provided to close the covers.

[줄 1490] [91.3%] (21/23) ✅ 유지 - These and the stiffened beams have the required statutory scantlings but an increase in the freeboard is the penalty for fitting such covers.
[줄 1491] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - The beams sit in sockets at the hatch coamings and the covers are protected by at least two tarpaulins.
[줄 1492] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - At the coaming the tarpaulins are made fast by battens and wedges fitted in cleats, and the sections of the cover are held down by locked bars or other securing arrangements.
[줄 1493] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Bulwarks Bulwarks fitted on weather decks are provided as protection for personnel and are not intended as a major structural feature.
[줄 1494] [92.6%] (25/27) ✅ 유지 - They are therefore of light scantlings, and their connections to the adjacent structures are of some importance if high stresses in the bulkwarks are to be avoided.
[줄 1495] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Freeing ports are cut in bulwarks, forming wells on decks in order that water may quickly drain away.
[줄 1496] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The required area of freeing ports is in accordance with the Load Line Convention requirement.
[줄 1497] [91.2%] (31/34) ✅ 유지 - Construction of bulwarks Bulwarks should be at least 1 m high on the exposed freeboard and superstructure decks, but a reduced height may be permitted if this interferes with the working of the ship.

[줄 1506] [88.5%] (23/26) ✅ 유지 - Superstructures and deckhouses Superstructures may be defined as those erections above the freeboard deck that extend to the ship's side or almost to the side.
[줄 1507] [88.2%] (15/17) ✅ 유지 - Deckhouses are those erections on deck that are well within the line of the ship's side.
[줄 1508] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Both structures are of importance in the assignment of the load line as they provide protection for the openings through the freeboard deck.
[줄 1509] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Of particular importance in this respect are the end bulkheads of the superstructures, particularly the bridge front, which is to withstand the force of any seas shipped.
[줄 1510] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The bridge structure amidships or the poop aft are, in accordance with statutory regulations, provided as protection for the machinery openings.
[줄 1511] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - It is possible, however, to dispense with these houses or superstructures and increase considerably the scantlings of the exposed machinery casing, but in other than very small vessels it is unlikely that such an arrangement would be adopted.
[줄 1512] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Unless an excessive sheer is provided on the uppermost deck it is necessary to fit a forecastle forward to give added protection in a seaway.
[줄 1513] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Each structure is utilized to the full, the after structure carrying virtually all the accommodation in modern ships.
[줄 1514] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - The crew may be located all aft in the poop structure or partly housed in any bridge structure with the navigating spaces.
[줄 1515] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Passenger liners have considerable areas of superstructures covering tiers of decks and these will house the majority of passengers and some of the crew.
[줄 1516] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - Of great structural importance is the strength of the vessel where superstructures and deckhouses terminate and are noncontinuous.
[줄 1517] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - At these discontinuities, discussed in Chapter 8, large stresses may arise and additional strengthening will be required locally as indicated in the following notes on the construction.
[줄 1518] [88.9%] (40/45) ✅ 유지 - Long superstructures exceeding 15% of the ship's length and extending within 50% of the vessel's length amidships receive special consideration as they contribute to the longitudinal strength of the ship, and as such must have scantlings consistent with the main hull strength members.
[줄 1519] [95.2%] (40/42) ✅ 유지 - Forecastle Sea-going ships must be fitted with a forecastle that extends at least 7% of the ship's length aft of the stem, and a minimum height of the bow at the forecastle deck above the summer load line is stipulated.
[줄 1520] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - By increasing the upper deck sheer at the forward end to obtain the same height of bow, the forecastle might be dispensed with, but in practice this construction is seldom found.
[줄 1521] [97.3%] (36/37) ✅ 유지 - The side and end plating of the forecastle has a thickness that is dependent on the ship's length and the frame and stiffener spacing adopted, the side plating being somewhat heavier than the aft end plating.
[줄 1522] [91.7%] (22/24) ✅ 유지 - If a long forecastle is fitted such that its end bulkhead comes within 50% of the ship's length amidships, additional stiffening is required.
[줄 1523] [90.0%] (36/40) ✅ 유지 - Bridge structures The side of bridge superstructures whose length exceeds 15% of the ship's length will have a greater thickness than the sides of other houses, the scantling being similar to that required for the ship's side shell.
[줄 1524] [92.3%] (24/26) ✅ 유지 - All bridge superstructures and midship deckhouses will have a heavily plated bridge front, and the aft end plating will be lighter than the front and sides.
[줄 1525] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - Likewise the stiffening members fitted at the forward end will have greater scantlings than those at the sides and aft end.
[줄 1526] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Additional stiffening in the form of web frames or partial bulkheads will be found where there are large erections above the bridge deck.
[줄 1527] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - These are intended to support the sides and ends of the houses above and are preferably arranged over the watertight bulkheads below.
[줄 1528] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Under concentrated loads on the superstructure decks, for example under lifeboat davits, web frames are also provided.
[줄 1529] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The longer bridge superstructure that is transmitting the main hull girder stresses requires considerable strengthening at the ends.
[줄 1530] [85.2%] (23/27) ✅ 유지 - At this major discontinuity, the upper deck sheerstrake thickness is increased by 20%, the upper deck stringer plate by 20%, and the bridge side plating by 25%.
[줄 1531] [83.8%] (31/37) ✅ 유지 - The latter plating is tapered into the upper deck sheerstrake with a generous radius, as shown in Figure 19.8 a, stiffened at its upper edge, and supported by webs not more than 1.5 m apart.
[줄 1532] [91.9%] (34/37) ✅ 유지 - At the ends of short bridge superstructures less strengthening is required, but local stresses may still be high and therefore the upper deck sheerstrake thickness is still increased by 20% and the upper deck stringer by 20%.
[줄 1533] [89.7%] (26/29) ✅ 유지 - Poop structure Where there is no midship deckhouse or bridge superstructure the poop front will be heavily constructed, its scantlings being similar to those required for a bridge front.
[줄 1534] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - In other ships it is relatively exposed and therefore needs adequate strengthening in all cases.
[줄 1535] [89.5%] (34/38) ✅ 유지 - If the poop front comes within 50% of the ship's length amidships, the discontinuity formed in the main hull girder is to be considerably strengthened, as for a long bridge exceeding 15% of the ship's length.
[줄 1536] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Where deckhouses are built above the poop deck these are supported by webs or short transverse bulkheads in the same manner as those houses fitted amidships.
[줄 1537] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - The after end of any poop house will have increased scantlings since it is more exposed than other aft end house bulkheads.
[줄 1538] [97.2%] (35/36) ✅ 유지 - Passenger ship superstructures It is shown in Chapter 8 that with conventional beam theory the bending stress distribution is linear, increasing from zero at the neutral axis to a maximum at the upper deck and bottom.
[줄 1539] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - If a long superstructure is fitted the stress distribution remains linear and the strength deck is above the upper deck in way of the superstructure deck.
[줄 1540] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - If a short superstructure is fitted the stress distribution will be broken at the upper deck, which is the strength deck, the stresses in the superstructure deck being less than those in the upper deck.
[줄 1541] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The long superstructure is referred to as an 'effective superstructure', the erections contributing to the overall strength of the hull girder, and therefore they are substantially built.

[줄 1546] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - The large bulk carrier originated as an ore carrier on the Great Lakes at the beginning of the twentieth century.
[줄 1547] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - For the period of the Second World War dedicated bulk carriers were only built spasmodically for ocean trading, since a large amount of these cargoes could be carried by general cargo tramps with the advantage of their being able to take return cargoes.
[줄 1548] [88.9%] (40/45) ✅ 유지 - A series of turret-deck steamers were built for ore-carrying purposes between 1904 and 1910; a section through such a vessel is illustrated in Figure 3.4 a Since 1945 a substantial number of ocean-going ore carriers have been built of uniform design.
[줄 1549] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - This form of ore carrier with a double bottom and side ballast tanks first appeared in 1917, only at that time the side tanks did not extend to the full hold depth.
[줄 1550] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - To overcome the disadvantage that the ore carrier was only usefully employed on one leg of the voyage, the oil/ore carrier also evolved at that time.
[줄 1551] [90.9%] (30/33) ✅ 유지 - The latter ship type carried oil in the wing tanks, as shown in Figure 3.4 c, and had a passageway for crew protection in order to obtain the deeper draft permitted tankers.
[줄 1552] [90.9%] (30/33) ✅ 유지 - The common general bulk carrier that predominated in the latter half of the twentieth century took the form shown in Figure 3.4 d with double bottom, hopper sides, and deck wing tanks.
[줄 1553] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - These latter tanks have been used for the carriage of light grain cargoes as well as water ballast.
[줄 1554] [87.9%] (29/33) ✅ 유지 - Specific variations of this type have been built; Figure 3.4 e shows a 'universal bulk carrier' patented by the McGregor International Organization that offered a very flexible range of cargo stowage solutions.
[줄 1555] [78.6%] (11/14) ✅ 유지 - Another type, shown in Figure 3.4 f, had alternate holds of short length.
[줄 1556] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - On single voyages the vessel could carry high-density cargoes only in the short holds to give an acceptable cargo distribution.
[줄 1557] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Such stowage is not uncommon on general bulk carriers with uniform hold lengths where alternate hold loading or block hold loading may be utilized to stow high-density cargoes.
[줄 1558] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - With such loading arrangements high shear forces occur at the ends of the holds, requiring additional strengthening of the side shell in way of the bulkheads.
[줄 1559] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - A general arrangement of a typical bulk carrier shows a clear deck with machinery aft.
[줄 1560] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Large hatches with steel covers are designed to facilitate rapid loading and discharge of the cargo.
[줄 1561] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Since the bulk carrier makes many voyages in ballast, a large ballast capacity is provided to give adequate immersion of the propeller.
[줄 1562] [86.4%] (19/22) ✅ 유지 - The size of this type of ship has also steadily increased and the largest bulk carriers have reached 365,000 tonnes deadweight.
[줄 1563] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - Ships of the general bulk carrier form experienced a relatively high casualty rate during the late 1980s and early 1990s, giving rise to concern as to their design and construction.
[줄 1564] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Throughout the late 1990s bulk carrier safety received considerable attention in the work of IMO, the classification societies and elsewhere.
[줄 1565] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - Based on experience of failures of lesser consequence, it was concluded that the casualties occurred through local structural failure leading to loss of watertight integrity of the side shell, followed by progressive flooding through damaged bulkheads.
[줄 1566] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The flooding resulted either in excessive hull bending stresses or excessive trim, and loss of the ship.
[줄 1567] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Much of this work concentrated on the structural hull details, stresses experienced as the result of loading and discharging cargoes, damage to structure and
[줄 1568] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - In passenger ships with large superstructures the present practice is to make the structure effective with adequate scantlings.
[줄 1569] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Some older ships have been fitted with expansion joints that are in effect transverse cuts introduced to relieve the hull bending stresses in the houses.
[줄 1570] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - It has been shown that at the end of deck erections the stresses do not conform to beam theory and the ends are ineffective in contributing to the longitudinal strength.
[줄 1571] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - The expansion joints were therefore so arranged that this 'end effect' extended from joint to joint, and lighter scantlings were then permitted for the superstructure.
[줄 1572] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Unfortunately the expansion joint often provided an ideal 'notch' in the structure from which cracks initiated.
[줄 1573] [100.0%] (42/42) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum alloy superstructures offer an alternative to the use of expansion joints, since the low modulus of elasticity of the material results in lower stresses in the houses than would be the case with a steel superstructure, all other considerations being equal.
[줄 1574] [90.9%] (20/22) ✅ 유지 - Weathertight doors The integrity of houses on the freeboard and other decks that protect the openings in these decks must be maintained.
[줄 1575] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Access openings must be provided to the houses and weathertight doors are fitted to these openings.
[줄 1576] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - These must comply with the requirements of the Load Line Convention and are steel doors that may be secured and made watertight from either side.
[줄 1577] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Weathertightness is maintained by a rubber gasket at the frame of the door.

[줄 1585] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The chain locker is included as it is usually fitted forward of the collision bulkhead below the second deck or upper deck, or in the forecastle itself.
[줄 1586] [87.1%] (27/31) ✅ 유지 - An overall view of the fore end structure is shown in Figures 20.1 and 20.2, and it can be seen that the panting stiffening arrangements are of particular importance.
[줄 1587] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - These have already been dealt with in detail in Chapter 17 as they are closely associated with the shell plating.
[줄 1588] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - On the forecastle deck the heavy windlass seating is securely fastened and given considerable support.
[줄 1589] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - The deck plating thickness is increased locally, and smaller pillars with heavier beams and local fore and aft intercostals, or a center-line pillar bulkhead, may be fitted below the windlass.
[줄 1590] [97.5%] (39/40) ✅ 유지 - Stem On many conventional ships a stem bar, which is a solid round bar, is fitted from the keel to the waterline region, and a radiused plate is fitted above the waterline to form the upper part of the stem.
[줄 1591] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - This forms what is referred to as a 'soft nose' stem, which in the event of a collision will buckle under load, keeping the impact damage to a minimum.
[줄 1592] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Older ships had solid bar stems that were riveted and of square section, and as the stem had no rake it could cause considerable damage on impact because of its rigidity.
[줄 1593] [100.0%] (40/40) ✅ 유지 - Small ships such as tugs and trawlers may still have a solid stem bar extending to the top of the bow, and some existing large passenger ships may have steel castings or forgings forming the lower part of the stem.
[줄 1594] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - A specially designed bow is required for ships assigned 'Icebreaker' notation and additional scantlings are required for the stems of ships assigned other ice classes.

[줄 1600] [95.2%] (40/42) ✅ 유지 - It is necessary to support that part of the stem that is formed by radiused plates with 'breast hooks', i.e horizontal plate webs, between the decks and below the lowest deck, in order to reduce the unsupported span of the stem.
[줄 1601] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Where the plate radius is large, further stiffening is provided by a vertical stiffener on the center line.
[줄 1602] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The thickness of these plates will be in excess of that required for the side shell forward, but the thickness may taper to that of the side shell at the stem head.

[줄 1609] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - From the construction point of view the bulbous bow does not present any great difficulty if this aspect has been considered when the bulb form is designed.
[줄 1610] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - In general, however, a greater degree of plate curvature is involved, unless a rather convenient cylindrical form is adopted and fitted into the bow as a single unit.
[줄 1611] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - This has in fact been done successfully; but in general the protrusion forms a continuation of the side shell.
[줄 1612] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Floors are fitted at every frame space in the bulb, and a center line wash bulkhead is introduced when the bulb is large.

[줄 1616] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - This increased thickness should in particular cover any area likely to be damaged by the anchors and chains, and in designing the bow fouling of the anchors should be taken into consideration.
[줄 1617] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - Chain locker A chain locker is often arranged in the position forward of the collision bulkhead shown in Figure 20.1, below either the main deck or the second deck.
[줄 1618] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - It can also be fitted in the forecastle or aft of the collision bulkhead, in which case it must be watertight and have proper means of drainage.

[줄 1797] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Single-screw tugs and trawlers are often fitted with the fixed patent 'Kort nozzle' where under a heavy tow the propeller is working at a high slip.
[줄 1798] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - This nozzle has a reducing diameter aft and is relatively short in relation to the diameter, to avoid increasing the directional stability, thus making steering difficult.
[줄 1799] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - When running freely the slip is much lower, and it might appear that there was little advantage in fitting a shrouded propeller.
[줄 1800] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - However, serious consideration has been given to fitting shrouded propellers on very large single-screw ships where there is a problem of absorbing the large powers on the limited diameter.

[줄 1836] [100.0%] (40/40) ✅ 유지 - The former vessels, the smaller of which may have a single center-line longitudinal bulkhead, have a greater number of tanks, and more complicated pumping arrangements that permit the carriage of a number of different products on a single voyage.
[줄 1837] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Both types of ship have traditionally been single flush deck ships with longitudinal bulkheads and a structure within the tank spaces consisting of a grillage of longitudinal and transverse members.
[줄 1838] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - The structural arrangement over the cargo tank length is dictated by the requirements of the MARPOL convention.
[줄 1839] [84.7%] (50/59) ✅ 유지 - Since 1980 new crude tankers of 20,000 tonnes deadweight or more and new products carriers of 30,000 tonnes deadweight or morewere required to be provided with segregated ballast tanks, the capacity of the SBTs being so determined that the ship could operate safely on ballast voyages without recourse to the use of cargo tanks for ballast water.
[줄 1840] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - These SBTs were to be located within the cargo tank length and arranged to provide a measure of protection against oil outflow in the event of grounding and or collision.
[줄 1841] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The protective location of these tanks had the effect of providing full or partial double bottoms and/or side tanks in way of the cargo tank space.
[줄 1842] [91.5%] (43/47) ✅ 유지 - Subsequent amendments to MARPOL required every tanker of 5000 tonnes deadweight or more that commenced construction after 1993 to have the entire cargo tank length protected by ballast tanks or spaces other than cargo and fuel oil tanks, or other provisions offering equivalent protection against oil pollution.

[줄 1847] [82.5%] (33/40) ✅ 유지 - Grade E plates, which we have equated with the 'crack arrester strake' concept, will be seen to be required over the midship region in ships exceeding 250 meters in length and are also required as shown in Table 22.1.
[줄 1848] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Higher tensile steel Higher tensile steels are often used for the deck and bottom regions of the larger tankers, Grades DH and EH being used for the heavier plating.

[줄 1861] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - For products carriers the deck longitudinals may be fitted above the deck to provide a flush internal tank surface for cleaning.
[줄 1862] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - An important feature of the longitudinal framing is that continuity of strength is maintained, particularly at the bulkheads forming the ends of the tanks.
[줄 1863] [97.3%] (36/37) ✅ 유지 - This feature is increasingly important as the ship length is extended, the bottom and deck longitudinals being continuous through the bulkhead where the ship length is excessive, unless an alternative arrangement is permitted by the classification society.

[줄 1939] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - As the machinery is aft the poop front merits special attention, and is in fact structurally similar to the bridge front, since its integrity is essential.
[줄 1940] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - A particular feature of the tanker with its lower freeboard is the requirement for an access gangway at the level of the first tier of superstructure between accommodation spaces.
[줄 1941] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - This is still often found on vessels with all accommodation aft, although the regulations would permit a rail or similar safety arrangement at the deck level.
[줄 1942] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - The provision of a gangway in the latter case is at the owner's wish, and is an added safety factor at greater initial cost, requiring additional maintenance.
[줄 1943] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Another feature is the absence of bulwarks on the main decks, the regulations requiring the provision of open rails over at least half the length of the wells, which are often awash in heavy weather.

[줄 1951] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - The vessels are moored using a turret system forward, which allows the hull to weathervane into the wind and waves to reduce dynamic loading on the hull girder.
[줄 1952] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - However, because the waves will be coming mainly towards the bow for the whole of its life, the hull girder will experience greater fatigue problems than would be the case for a conventional tanker.
[줄 1953] [91.2%] (31/34) ✅ 유지 - The conventional tanker carries little in the way of loading on its main deck, whereas an FPSO is fitted with a substantial oil production facility, which can weigh in excess of 20,000 tons.
[줄 1954] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - This loading needs to be transferred into the hull structure, which means that vertical structural components are more complex and substantial than those of a tanker.
[줄 1955] [94.3%] (33/35) ✅ 유지 - Further, because both FSUs and FPSOs are expected to remain on station for their lifetime and withstand arduous conditions without dry-docking, the exposed hull construction is generally upgraded and strengthened with increased corrosion protection.

[줄 2111] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - The cargo section is transversely or longitudinally framed, depending primarily on size, in the same manner as other cargo ships, the inner hull receiving special consideration where it is required to support the containment system.
[줄 2112] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - All gas ships have spaces around the tanks that are monitored for gas leaks and in many ships these spaces are also inerted, an inert gas system being fitted aboard the ship.
[줄 2113] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Liquid gas cargoes are carried under positive pressure at all times so that no air can enter the tanks and create a flammable mixture.
[줄 2114] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Liquefaction equipment is provided aboard LPG ships; 'boil-off' vapor from the tanks due to any heat ingress is drawn into the liquefaction plant and returned to the tank.

[줄 2136] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Significant changes have been in the use of containers for mixed cargoes, replacing traditional break-bulk dry cargo ships, bulk carriers for coal, ore, grain and similar cargoes, and roll-on roll-off ships.
[줄 2137] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Faster loading and discharge of cargoes has demanded faster handling, with cargoes in greater units, or continuous loading for example for bulk carriers.
[줄 2138] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - There has been a very considerable reduction in the number of shipyard-built and rigged derricks as shipboard lifting devices.

[줄 2140] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Cranes have greater capacity, are less labor intensive, faster operating, more easily controlled, and require less deck area.
[줄 2141] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - They do, however, require a higher degree of onboard maintenance.
[줄 2142] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - When ordering a new ship the shipowner normally specifies the number, safe working load, position, and any special features of the cargo lifting devices to be fitted.
[줄 2143] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - The shipbuilder or a specialized supplier will determine the equipment and arrangements required to satisfy the owner's requirements.
[줄 2144] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Shipboard cranes Many ships rely on shore-based loading and unloading, especially the larger ships that require high discharge rates for a rapid turnaround.
[줄 2145] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Larger ships also are more likely to run on fixed routes, between larger terminals that are fully equipped for rapid loading and unloading.

[줄 2152] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - Welding has also allowed cheaper fabrication methods to be adopted.
[줄 2153] [97.8%] (44/45) ✅ 유지 - Longitudinal framing was adopted at an early date for the larger ships and revision of the construction rules in the late 1960s allowed the length of tank spaces to be increased, with a subsequent reduction in steel weight, making it easier to pump discharge cargoes.
[줄 2154] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - As far as the general arrangement is concerned, there appears always to have been a trend towards placing the machinery aft.
[줄 2155] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Moving all the accommodation and bridge aft was a later feature and is desirable from the fire protection point of view.
[줄 2156] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Location of the accommodation in one area is more economic from a building point of view, since all services are only to be provided at a single location.
[줄 2157] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - The requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and particularly its Protocol of 1978 have greatly influenced the arrangement of the cargo spaces of oil tankers.
[줄 2158] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - A major feature of the MARPOL Convention and its Protocol has been the provision in larger tankers of clean water ballast capacity.
[줄 2159] [97.1%] (33/34) ✅ 유지 - Whilst primarily intended to reduce the pollution risk, the fitting of segregated water ballast tanks in the midship region aids the reduction of the still water bending moment when the tanker is fully loaded.
[줄 2160] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - It also reduces corrosion problems associated with tank spaces, which are subject to alternate oil and sea water ballast cargoes.
[줄 2161] [91.7%] (33/36) ✅ 유지 - In March 1989 the tanker Exxon Valdez, which complied fully with the then current MARPOL requirements, ran aground and discharged 11 million gallons of crude oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound in Alaska.
[줄 2162] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The subsequent public outcry led to the United States Congress passing the Oil Pollution Act 1990.
[줄 2163] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - This unilateral action by the United States government made it a requirement that existing single-hull oil tankers operating in United States waters were to be phased out by an early date, after which all oil tankers were to have a double hull.
[줄 2164] [90.5%] (19/21) ✅ 유지 - In November 1990 the USA suggested that the MARPOL Convention should be amended to make double hulls compulsory for new tankers.
[줄 2165] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - A number of other IMO member states suggested that alternative designs offering equivalent protection against accidental oil spills should be accepted.
[줄 2166] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - In particular, Japan proposed an alternative, the mid-deck tanker.
[줄 2167] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - This design has side ballast tanks providing protection against collision but no double bottom.
[줄 2168] [91.8%] (45/49) ✅ 유지 - The cargo tank space had a structural deck running its full length at about 0.25–0.5 the depth from the bottom, which ensures that should the bottom be ruptured the upward pressure exerted by the sea would prevent most of the oil from escaping into the sea.
[줄 2169] [87.2%] (41/47) ✅ 유지 - In 1992 IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL that required tankers of 5000 tonnes deadweight and above contracted for after July 1993, or which commenced construction after January 1994, to be of double-hulled or mid-deck construction, or of other design offering equivalent protection against oil pollution.
[줄 2170] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Existing tankers with single hulls without segregated ballast tanks with protective location were to be phased out by June 2007.
[줄 2171] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Those with segregated ballast tanks with protective location were to be phased out by July 2021.

[줄 2203] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - In modern ships there is a tendency to simplify the rigging, which can restrict cargo handling.
[줄 2204] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Shrouds are often dispensed with and preventers may only be rigged when heavy derricks are used.
[줄 2205] [84.6%] (11/13) ✅ 유지 - Each mast or post has adequate scantlings so that they may remain unstayed.
[줄 2206] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Mast construction and stiffening Tubular steel sections are commonly used in mast and post construction, the sections being rolled in short lengths and welded in the shipyard.
[줄 2207] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The short lengths may be tapered and are of different plate thicknesses to allow for the greater stresses experienced at the base of the mast.
[줄 2208] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Where connections are made for fittings such as the gooseneck and a masthead span swivel, doubling or welded reinforcing pads may be provided.
[줄 2209] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - To obtain the necessary mast scantlings, excessive doubling or internal stiffeners are rarely found in modern practice, except where a heavier derrick than that for which the mast was originally designed is carried.
[줄 2210] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - Higher tensile steels are often used to advantage in mast construction, giving less weight high up in the ship and dispensing with the need for any form of support, without excessive scantlings.
[줄 2211] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Cross-trees, mast tables, etc may be fabricated from welded steel plates and sections.
[줄 2212] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Derrick booms are as a rule welded lengths of seamless tubular steel.
[줄 2213] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The middle length may have a greater diameter to allow for the bending moment, to which the boom is subject in addition to the axial thrust.
[줄 2214] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - At the base of the mast adequate rigidity must be provided, the amount of additional structural stiffening increasing with the size of derricks carried by the mast.
[줄 2215] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Many cargo ships have mast houses into which the masts are built, the house being suitably strengthened.
[줄 2216] [92.0%] (23/25) ✅ 유지 - These houses need not be designed to support the mast, the structure being of light scantlings and the support provided by stiffening in the tweens.
[줄 2217] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Where the house is strengthened the masts or posts generally land on the upper deck, but where heavy derricks are installed the mast may then land on the upper tween deck.
[줄 2218] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Since the derricks and mast are as a rule midway between holds they land over the hold transverse bulkheads, which lend further support.
[줄 2219] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - Heavy derrick masts will require extensive stiffening arrangements in the mast house, and also in the tweens, with support for the transverse bulkhead so that the loads are transmitted through the structure to the ship's bottom.
[줄 2220] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Partial longitudinal and transverse bulkheads with deck girders may provide the mast house stiffening.
[줄 2221] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Stiffened plate webs at the ship's center line in the tweens and heavier stiffeners on the transverse bulkhead in the hold then provide the additional strengthening below decks.

[줄 2233] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Where a weight exceeding the safe working load of the derricks is to be lifted, the 'yo-yo' rig is sometimes adopted.
[줄 2234] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - The heads of the derricks are brought together, and a traveling block may be arranged on the cargo runner or a wire connecting the two cargo purchases as illustrated.
[줄 2235] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - Both the 'butterfly' and 'yo-yo' rigs give a load pattern similar to the 'union purchase' and 'single swinging derrick' rigs for which calculations are made, but the guy loads with each can be particularly severe.
[줄 2236] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Patent derricks are generally of the single swinging type with some form of powered slewing.
[줄 2237] [75.0%] (9/12) ✅ 유지 - The Hallen swinging derrick is shown diagrammatically in Figure 24.5 a.
[줄 2238] [97.5%] (39/40) ✅ 유지 - This type of derrick may be installed at the ship's center line to reach outboard on both sides of the ship and is controlled by a single operator in a manner not unlike the operation of a mechanical crane.
[줄 2239] [88.9%] (16/18) ✅ 유지 - As a rule the safe working load of this type of derrick is between 10 and 80 tonnes.
[줄 2240] [85.3%] (29/34) ✅ 유지 - Of particular note in the very heavy lifting range is the patent Stu ̈lken derrick marketed by Blohm and Voss AG, which may have a safe working load of between 80 and 300 tonnes.
[줄 2241] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - One advantage that this derrick has is its ability to serve two hatches, the boom swinging through an arc between the posts in the fore and aft directions.
[줄 2242] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Forces in derrick rigs The geometry of the derrick rig will to a large extent influence the loads carried by the rig components.
[줄 2243] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Those dimensions that have the greatest influence are the length of boom, the distance between the boom heel and the masthead span connection, and the angle at which the boom is topped.
[줄 2244] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - When the ratio between boom length and height of suspension is increased, the boom thrust will be higher; therefore, should a long boom be required the height of suspension must be adequate.
[줄 2245] [100.0%] (42/42) ✅ 유지 - It is not unusual, however, for shipowners to object to having posts at the bridge front and if the height of suspension is then restricted there is some limitation on the boom length, which can make working cargo from that position difficult.
[줄 2246] [100.0%] (40/40) ✅ 유지 - The angle at which the derrick is topped has no effect on the axial thrust, but the lead from the cargo purchase often increases the thrust as it is led parallel to the boom on all except heavy lift derricks.
[줄 2247] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - Loads carried by the span are dependent on both the ratio of boom length to height of suspensionandtheangleatwhichthederrickistopped.

[줄 2249] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - To determine these forces simple space and force diagrams may be drawn and the resultant forces determined to give the required wire sizes, block and connection safe working loads, and the thrust experienced by the boom.
[줄 2250] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - The horizontal and vertical components of the span load and boom thrust are also used to determine the mast scantlings.
[줄 2251] [88.9%] (16/18) ✅ 유지 - Force diagrams are shown for the rig components of the single swinging derrick illustrated in Figure 24.6.
[줄 2252] [92.9%] (39/42) ✅ 유지 - For a safe working load of 15 tonnes or less the forces may be calculated with the derrick at angles of 30  and 70  to the horizontal unless the owner specifies that the derrick is to be used at a lower angle.

[줄 2259] [87.5%] (14/16) ✅ 유지 - than 15 tonnes the forces may be calculated at an angle of 45  to the horizontal.
[줄 2260] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - The loads on all the blocks except the lower block of a cargo purchase will be the resultant of the two forces to which the block is subjected.
[줄 2261] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - A single-sheave block has a safe working load that is half the resultant, and multi-sheave blocks have a safe working load that is the same as the resultant.
[줄 2262] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - In determining the span loads and boom thrusts, not only is the derrick safe working load considered to be supported by the span, but also the weight of the cargo purchase and half the boom weight.
[줄 2263] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - The other half of the boom weight is supported by the gooseneck fitting.
[줄 2264] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Allowances must be made for the frictional resistance of the blocks when determining the forces.
[줄 2265] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - This includes an allowance for the rope friction, i.e the effort required to bend and unbend the rope around the pulley, as well as an allowance for journal friction.
[줄 2266] [90.2%] (74/82) ✅ 유지 - Shipbuilders using British Standards adopt the following assumed cumulative friction values: Small and medium sheaves 8% sheave with bushed plain bearings 5% sheave with ball or roller bearings Large diameter sheaves 6% sheave with bushed plain bearings 4% sheave with ball or roller bearings Derrick exceeding 80 tonnes SWL 5% sheave with bushed plain bearings 3% sheave with ball or roller bearings Force diagrams that are more involved than those for the single swinging derrick are prepared for the union purchase rig.
[줄 2267] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - These diagrams indicate the safe working load of the rig, the 'limiting height', the boom thrusts, and the optimum guy leads.
[줄 2268] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - The 'limiting height' is that height below which all positions of the lifted weight will result in an included angle between the outboard and inboard runners of less than 120 .
[줄 2269] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - At 120 , if the boom heads are level the inboard and outboard runners will experience a force equivalent to the cargo weight.
[줄 2270] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Usually the runner size determines the safe working load in union purchase, but the thrust experienced by the derrick boom can determine this value where only light derricks are fitted.
[줄 2271] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The positioning of the guys may be important to the loads experienced by the span and the guys themselves.
[줄 2272] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - If these are at too narrow an angle to the boom, excessive tension in the guys will result; a good lead is therefore essential.
[줄 2273] [97.4%] (37/38) ✅ 유지 - Unfortunately, in practice the magnitude of the guy loads is not always appreciated, but more attention has been paid to this problem of late and preventers are now often set up to reduce the load in the guy.
[줄 2274] [90.5%] (19/21) ✅ 유지 - There is available a suitable preventer for this purpose; the use of old runners etc as preventers should not be tolerated.
[줄 2275] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - In union purchase rigs it is possible to obtain a condition where the load comes off the outboard span, and the boom may then close to the mast under load.
[줄 2276] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - This condition is referred to as 'jack-knifing', and may be apparent from the force diagram prepared for the rig, since the triangle of forces does not close.
[줄 2277] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - At the design stage the guy positions can be adjusted to avoid this happening.
[줄 2278] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - In practice this condition appears to occur occasionally where derricks are used in union purchase at the bridge front.
[줄 2279] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - Here the positioning of the guys is made difficult by the presence of the bridge structure, but the correct placing of a suitable preventer should overcome this problem.
[줄 2280] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - Studies by IMO and the US National Academy of Sciences confirmed the effectiveness of the double hull in preventing oil spills caused by grounding and collision where the inner hull is not breached.
[줄 2281] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The mid-deck tanker was shown to have more favorable outflow performance in extreme accidents where the inner hull is breached.
[줄 2282] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - The United States authorities considered grounding the most prevalent type of accident in their waters and believed only the double-hull type prevented spills from tanker groundings in all but the most severe incidents.
[줄 2283] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Thus, whilst MARPOL provided for the acceptance of alternative tanker designs, the United States legislation did not, and no alternative designs were built.
[줄 2284] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - As the result of the break-up of the tanker Erika and subsequent pollution of the French coastline in 1999, IMO members decided to accelerate the phase-out of singlehull tankers.
[줄 2285] [91.3%] (21/23) ✅ 유지 - As a result, in April 2001 a stricter timetable for the phasing out of single-hull tankers entered into force in September 2003.
[줄 2286] [84.8%] (28/33) ✅ 유지 - In December 2003 a decision to further accelerate the phase-out dates of single-hull tankers was agreed, PreMARPOL tankers being phased out in 2005 and MARPOL tankers and small tankers in 2010.
[줄 2287] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Oil tankers now generally have a single pump space aft, adjacent to the machinery, and specified slop tanks into which tank washings and oily residues are pumped.
[줄 2288] [91.4%] (32/35) ✅ 유지 - Tank cleaning may be accomplished by water-driven rotating machines on the smaller tankers but for new crude oil tankers of 20,000 tonnes deadweight and above the tank cleaning system uses crude oil washing.
[줄 2289] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Passenger ships Early passenger ships did not have the tiers of superstructure associated with modern vessels, and they also had a narrower beam in relation to their length.
[줄 2290] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - The reason for the absence of superstructure decks was the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, which limited the number of passengers carried on the upper deck.
[줄 2291] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - An amendment to this Act in 1906 removed this restriction and vessels were then built with several tiers of superstructures.
[줄 2292] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - This produced problems of strength and stability, stability being improved by an increase in beam.
[줄 2293] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The transmission of stresses to the superstructure from the main hull girder created much difference of opinion as to the means of overcoming the problem.
[줄 2294] [90.0%] (27/30) ✅ 유지 - Both light structures of a discontinuous nature, i.e fitted with expansion joints, and superstructures withheavier scantlings able to contribute to the strength of the main hull girder were introduced.
[줄 2295] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Present practice, where the length of the superstructure is appreciable and has its sides at the ship side, does not require the fitting of expansion joints.
[줄 2296] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The introduction of aluminum alloy superstructures provided increased passenger accommodation on the same draft, and/or a lowering of the lightweight center of gravity with improved stability.
[줄 2297] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - This was brought about by the lighter weight of the aluminum alloy structure.
[줄 2298] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Subsequent experience, however, has shown that for passenger liners, that are required to maintain a service speed in a seaway, the maintenance costs of aluminum alloy superstructures can be higher.
[줄 2299] [81.9%] (59/72) ✅ 유지 - Initial tests and re-tests of derrick rigs To comply with the national and class regulations, ships' derricks designed to operate as single swinging derricks are initially tested with a proof load that exceeds the specified safe working load of the derrick by the following amounts: SWL less than 20 tonnes25% in excess of SWL SWL 20–50 tonnes5 tonnes in excess of SWL SWL over 50 tonnes10% in excess of SWL.
[줄 2300] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - Heavy-lift derricks are tested at an angle of not more than 45  to the horizontal and other derricks at an angle of not more than 30  to the horizontal.
[줄 2301] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - During the test the boom is swung as far as possible in both directions, and any derrick intended to be raised by power under load is raised to its maximum working angle at the outermost position.
[줄 2302] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Before the test for a heavy derrick it is usual to ensure that the vessel has adequate transverse stability.
[줄 2303] [97.9%] (47/48) ✅ 유지 - Before, during, and after all tests it is necessary to ensure that none of the components of the rig show signs of any failure, and it is good practice to have a preventer rigged during the test as a precaution against any of the span gear carrying away.
[줄 2304] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - On completion of the test the heel of the derrick boom is clearly marked with: 1.

[줄 2371] [92.5%] (37/40) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's Register includes requirements for movable decks in their rules and if the ship is fitted with portable decks complying with these rules at the owner's or builder's request the class notation 'movable decks' may be assigned.
[줄 2372] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - Scissors lift Cargo can be lowered or raised between decks or to the hold by means of a scissors lift, which is sometimes fitted in ro-ro ships as an alternative to internal ramps, as it takes up less room.
[줄 2373] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - However, the scissor lift is slower in operation than ramps.
[줄 2374] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The hydraulic cylinder-powered scissors lift is also often designed to transfer heavy unit loads.
[줄 2375] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - Cargo restraint In ro-ro and container ships the lashing of cargo is an important safety consideration and usually calls for fittings that will permit rapid and easy but effective securing of the cargo because of short ship turnaround times.
[줄 2376] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - The shipbuilder is responsible for the deck and perhaps hatch fittings for the securing devices, and will look to the ship operator for guidance on their type and positions.
[줄 2377] [91.9%] (34/37) ✅ 유지 - On the decks of ro-ro ships where the direction of lashing is unpredictable and vehicles must transverse the fitting, a cloverleaf deck socket in conjunction with an elephant's foot type of end lashing is popular.
[줄 2378] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Containers have very little strength in any direction other thanvertically through the corner posts, thus it is necessary to provide substantial support to the containers when they are on the ship.
[줄 2379] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - Stowage of containers is with their longer dimension fore and aft since the ship motion transmitted to cargo is greater in rolling than pitching and it is therefore prudent to limit any possible cargo movement within the container to the shorter transverse dimension.
[줄 2380] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Also, of course, when offloading the fore and aft container is more easily received by road or rail transport.
[줄 2381] [91.3%] (42/46) ✅ 유지 - Below-decks containers are restrained in vertical cell guides, which are typically 150  150  12 angles and they are structurally supported so that any dynamic forces other than purely vertical are transmitted as much as possible through the ship's structure and not into the containers.
[줄 2382] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - The cell guides are not to form an integral part of the ship's structure, they are to be so designed that they do not carry the main hull stresses.
[줄 2383] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Where four container corners are adjacent the cell guides may be built into a composite pillar.
[줄 2384] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - The clearance between container and cell guide is critical.

[줄 2387] [85.0%] (17/20) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's stipulate a maximum clearance of 25 mm in the transverse direction and 40 mm in the longitudinal direction.
[줄 2388] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The tolerances are such that the cell guides have to be fitted to an accuracy exceeding normal shipyard practice with the use of jigs to ensure the dimensions are maintained following welding.
[줄 2389] [89.7%] (26/29) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's require that the cell guide not deviate from its intended line by more than 4 mm in the transverse direction and 5 mm in the longitudinal direction.
[줄 2390] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Lead-in devices are fitted at the top of the guides.
[줄 2391] [86.4%] (19/22) ✅ 유지 - Above-deck cell guides may also be provided, there being several patented arrangements such as the MacGregor-Navire International AB 'Stackcell' system.

[줄 2394] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - These are not widely used, however, and many ships carrying containers above deck rely on various deck and hatch sockets with locking and nonlocking stackers mating with the standard container corners, plus lashings to secure the containers.
[줄 2395] [86.7%] (13/15) ✅ 유지 - With locking stackers fewer lashings are required, therefore the more expensive twistlock is often favored.
[줄 2396] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - Deck sockets like the container corner fitting contain the standard ISO hole into which the stackers fit.

[줄 2405] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - A feature of the general arrangement is the reduction in size of the machinery space in this time.
[줄 2406] [87.9%] (29/33) ✅ 유지 - It is easy to see the reason for this if the Aquitania, built in 1914 and having direct drive turbines with 21 double-ended scotch boilers, is compared with the Queen Elizabeth 2.
[줄 2407] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The latter as originally built had geared drive turbines with three water tube boilers.
[줄 2408] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Many modern passenger ships have had their machinery placed aft; this gives over the best part of the vessel amidships entirely to passenger accommodation.
[줄 2409] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Against this advantage, however, allowance must be made for an increased bending moment if a suitable trim is to be obtained.
[줄 2410] [94.3%] (33/35) ✅ 유지 - The more recent provision of electric podded propulsors as fitted on the Queen Mary 2 has, with the removal of shaft lines, permitted optimization of the internal arrangements of the passenger liner and cruise ship.
[줄 2411] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Passenger accommodation standards have increased substantially, the volume of space allotted per passenger rising steadily.
[줄 2412] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Tween deck clearances are greater and public rooms extend through two or more decks, whilst enclosed promenade and atrium spaces are now common in these vessels.
[줄 2413] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The provision of air-conditioning and stabilizing devices has also added to passenger comfort.
[줄 2414] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Particular attention has been paid to fire safety in the modern passenger ship, structural materials of low fire risk being utilized in association with automatic extinguishing and detection systems.
[줄 2415] [97.8%] (45/46) ✅ 유지 - There has been a demise of the larger passenger liner and larger passenger ships are now either cruise ships, short-haul ferries, or special trade passenger ships, the latter being unberthed immigrant or pilgrim passenger ships operating in the Middle East to South East Asian region.
[줄 2416] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Whilst the safety of passenger ships in general has been good in recent years, the growth in the size and number of cruise ships has led IMO to initiate a review of passenger ship safety.
[줄 2417] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - In particular, it is looking at placing greater emphasis on the prevention of a casualty from occurring in the first place.
[줄 2418] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - That is, future passenger ships should be designed for improved survivability so that in the event of a casualty passengers and crew can stay safely on board as the ship proceeds to port.
[줄 2419] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - The development of high-speed passenger ferries of lightweight construction and often of radical hull form and/or nondisplacement modes of operation has been notable since the early 1980s.
[줄 2420] [85.2%] (23/27) ✅ 유지 - Initially relatively small, these craft may now be more than 100 meters in length and carry upwards of 500 persons plus 100 cars/30 trucks or more.
[줄 2421] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - The lightweight construction is usually of aluminum alloy
[줄 2422] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - but some have been constructed of lighter higher-tensile steels, and fiber-reinforced plastics may be used in the superstructure and accommodation areas.
[줄 2423] [88.9%] (32/36) ✅ 유지 - With speeds of up to 50 knots, many craft are of twin-hull form and include conventional catamarans, wave piercers with twin hulls and a faired buoyant bridging structure forward, and small waterplane twin-hulled ships.
[줄 2424] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The latter have a high proportion of their twin-hull buoyancy below the waterline.
[줄 2425] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Other high-speed craft include hydrofoils and various surface effect ships including hovercraft, which maintain a cushion of air, fully or partially, between the hull and the water to reduce drag.
[줄 2426] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - The increasing use of these vessels led in 1994 to the promulgation by IMO of specific international regulations concerning their design, safety, and operation.
[줄 2427] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - An updated version of this Code of Safety was adopted in December 2000.

[줄 2444] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - At the open ends of bilge suctions in holds and other compartments, outside the machinery space and shaft tunnel, a strum box is provided.
[줄 2445] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The strum box is a perforated plate box welded to the mouth of the bilge line, which prevents debris being taken up by the bilge pump suction.
[줄 2446] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Perforations in the strum box do not exceed 10 mm in diameter, and their total cross-sectional area is at least twice that required for the bore of the bilge pipe.
[줄 2447] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Strums are arranged at a reasonable height above the bottom of the bilge or drain well to allow a clear flow of water and to permit easy cleaning.

[줄 2579] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Atmospheric corrosion Protection against atmospheric corrosion is important during the construction of a ship, both on the building berth and in the shops.
[줄 2580] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Serious rusting may occur where the relative humidity is above about 70%; the atmosphere in many shipyards is unfortunately sufficiently humid to permit atmospheric corrosion throughout most of the year.
[줄 2581] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - However, even in humid atmospheres the rate of rusting is determined mainly by the pollution of the air through smoke and/or sea salts.

[줄 2586] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - At ordinary temperatures in aqueous solutions the transformation of a metal atom into a mineral molecule occurs by the metal passing into solution.
[줄 2587] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - During this process the atom loses one or more electrons and becomes an ion, i.e an electrically charged atom, with the production of an electric current.
[줄 2588] [93.3%] (14/15) ✅ 유지 - This reaction may only occur if an electron acceptor is present in the aqueous solution.
[줄 2589] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - Thus, any corrosion reaction is always accompanied by a flow of electricity from one metallic area to another through a solution in which the conduction of an electric current occurs by the passage of ions.

[줄 2603] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - The latter is typified by steel plate carrying broken millscale in sea water or corrosion currents flowing between areas of well-painted plate and areas of defective paintwork.
[줄 2604] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - In atmospheric corrosion and corrosion involving immersion, both oxygen and an electrolyte play an important part.
[줄 2605] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Plates freely exposed to the atmosphere will receive plenty of oxygen but little moisture, and the moisture present therefore becomes the controlling factor.
[줄 2606] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Under conditions of total immersion it is the presence of oxygen that becomes the controlling factor.
[줄 2607] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Bimetallic corrosion Although it is true to say that all corrosion is basically galvanic, the term 'galvanic corrosion' is usually applied when two different metals form a corrosion cell.
[줄 2608] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Many ship corrosion problems are associated with the coupling of metallic parts of different potential, which consequently form corrosion cells under service conditions.
[줄 2609] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - The corrosion rates of metals and alloys in sea water have been extensively investigated and as a result galvanic series of metals and alloys in sea water have been obtained.
[줄 2610] [84.6%] (11/13) ✅ 유지 - A typical galvanic series in sea water is shown in Table 27.1.
[줄 2611] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The positions of the metals in the table apply only in a sea water environment, and where metals are grouped together they have no strong tendency to form couples with each other.
[줄 2612] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Some metals appear twice because they are capable of having both a passive and an active state.
[줄 2613] [96.1%] (73/76) ✅ 유지 - A metal is said to be passive when the surface is exposed to an electrolyte solution and a reaction is expected but the metal shows no sign of Table 27.1 Galvanic series of metals and alloys in sea water Noble end Platinum, gold Silver Titanium Stainless steels, passive Nickel, passive High-duty bronzes Copper Nickel, active Millscale Naval brass Lead, tin Stainless steels, active Iron, steel, cast iron Aluminum alloys Aluminum Zinc Magnesium Ignoble end
[줄 2614] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - It is generally agreed that passivation results from the formation of a current barrier on the metal surface, usually in the form of an oxide film.
[줄 2615] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - This thin protective film forms, and a change in the overall potential of the metal occurs when a critical current density is exceeded at the anodes of the local corrosion cells on the metal surface.
[줄 2616] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Among the more common bimetallic corrosion cell problems in ship hulls are those formed by the mild steel hull with the bronze or nickel alloy propeller.
[줄 2617] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Also, above-the-waterline problems exist with the attachment of bronze and aluminum alloy fittings.
[줄 2618] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Where aluminum superstructures are introduced, the attachment to the steel hull and the fitting of steel equipment to the superstructure require special attention.
[줄 2619] [90.9%] (20/22) ✅ 유지 - This latter problem is overcome by insulating the two metals and preventing the ingress of water, as illustrated in Figure 27.2.
[줄 2620] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - A further development is the use of explosion-bonded aluminum/steel transition joints, also illustrated.
[줄 2621] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - These joints are free of any crevices, the exposed aluminum-to-steel interface being readily protected by paint.
[줄 2622] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Stress corrosion Corrosion and subsequent failure associated with varying forms of applied stress is not uncommon in marine structures.
[줄 2623] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Internal stresses produced by non-uniform cold working are often more dangerous than applied stresses.
[줄 2624] [90.9%] (10/11) ✅ 유지 - For example, localized corrosion is often evident at cold flanged brackets.
[줄 2625] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Corrosion/erosion Erosion is essentially a mechanical action but it is associated with electrochemical corrosion in producing two forms of metal deterioration.
[줄 2626] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - Firstly, in what is known as 'impingement attack', the action is mainly electrochemical but it is initiated by erosion.
[줄 2627] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Air bubbles entrained in the flow of water and striking a metal surface may erode away any protective film that may be present locally.
[줄 2628] [91.7%] (11/12) ✅ 유지 - The eroded surface becomes anodic to the surrounding surface and corrosion occurs.
[줄 2629] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - This type of attack can occur in most places where there is water flow, but particularly where features give rise to turbulent flow.
[줄 2630] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Sea water discharges from the hull are a particular case, the effects being worse if warm water is discharged.
[줄 2631] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Cavitation damage is also associated with a rapidly flowing liquid environment.
[줄 2632] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - At certain regions in the flow
[줄 2633] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - the local pressures drop below that of the absolute vapor pressure.
[줄 2634] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Vapor cavities, i.e areas of partial vacuum, are formed locally, but when the pressure increases clear of this region the vapor cavities collapse or 'implode'.
[줄 2635] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This collapse occurs with the release of considerable energy, and if it occurs adjacent to a metal surface damage results.
[줄 2636] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - The damage shows itself as pitting, which is thought to be predominantly due to the effects of the mechanical damage.
[줄 2637] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - However, it is also considered that electrochemical action may play some part in the damage after the initial erosion.

[줄 2643] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Corrosion allowance Plate and section scantlings specified for ships in the rules of classification societies include corrosion additions to the thickness, generally based on a 25-year service life.
[줄 2644] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - The corrosion allowance is based on the concept that corrosion occurs on the exposed surface of the material at a constant rate, no matter how much material lies behind it.
[줄 2645] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - That is, if a plate is 8 or 80 mm thick, corrosion will take place at the same rate, not at a faster rate in the thicker plate.
[줄 2646] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Some shipowners may specify thicker material than is required by the classification society, where there are plans for long-term ownership.
[줄 2647] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - Corrosion control The control of corrosion may be broadly considered in two forms, cathodic protection and the application of protective coatings, i.e paints.
[줄 2648] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Cathodic protection Only where metals are immersed in an electrolyte can the possible onset of corrosion be prevented by cathodic protection.
[줄 2649] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - The fundamental principle of cathodic protection is that the anodic corrosion reactions are suppressed by the application of an opposing current.
[줄 2650] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - This superimposed direct electric current enters the metal at every point, lowering the potential of the anode metal of the local corrosion cells so that they become cathodes.
[줄 2651] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - There are two main types of cathodic protection installation, sacrificial anode systems and impressed current systems.
[줄 2652] [84.4%] (27/32) ✅ 유지 - Sacri fi cial anode systems Sacrificial anodes are metals or alloys attached to the hull that have a more anodic, i.e less noble, potential than steel when immersed in sea water.
[줄 2653] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - These anodes supply the cathodic protection current, but will be consumed in doing so and therefore require replacement for the protection to be maintained.
[줄 2654] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - This system has been used for many years, the fitting of zinc plates in way of bronze propellers and other immersed fittings being common practice.
[줄 2655] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Initially, results with zinc anodes were not always very effective owing to the use of unsuitable zinc alloys.
[줄 2656] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Modern anodes are based on alloys of zinc, aluminum, or magnesium, which have undergone many tests to examine their suitability; high-purity zinc anodes are also used.
[줄 2657] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The cost, with various other practical considerations, may decide which type is to be fitted.
[줄 2658] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Sacrificial anodes may be fitted within the hull, and are often fitted in ballast tanks.
[줄 2659] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - However, magnesium anodes are not used in the cargo-ballast tanks of oil carriers owing to the 'spark hazard'.
[줄 2660] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Should any part of the anode fall and strike the tank structure when gaseous conditions exist, an explosion could result.
[줄 2661] [91.7%] (22/24) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum anode systems may be employed in tankers provided they are only fitted in locations where the potential energy is less than 28 kgm.
[줄 2662] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Impressed current systems These systems are applicable to the protection of the immersed external hull only.
[줄 2663] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The principle of the systems is that a voltage difference is maintained between the hull and fitted anodes, which will protect the hull against corrosion, but not overprotect it, thus wasting current.
[줄 2664] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - For normal operating conditions the potential difference is maintained by means of an externally mounted silver/silver chloride reference cell detecting the voltage difference between itself and the hull.
[줄 2665] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - An amplifier controller is used to amplify the micro-range reference cell current, and it compares this with the preset protective potential value that is to be maintained.
[줄 2666] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - Using the amplified DC signal from the controller, a saturable reactor controls a larger current from the ship's electrical system that is supplied to the hull anodes.
[줄 2667] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - An AC current from the electrical system would be rectified before distribution to the anodes.
[줄 2668] [71.4%] (5/7) ✅ 유지 - Figure 27.3 shows such a system.
[줄 2669] [76.0%] (19/25) ✅ 유지 - Originally consumable anodes were employed, but in recent systems nonconsumable relativelynoble metalsareused; these include lead/silverand platinum/palladiumalloys, and platinized titanium anodes are also used.
[줄 2670] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - A similar impressed current system employs a consumable anode in the form of an aluminum wire up to 45 meters long that is trailed behind the ship whilst at sea.
[줄 2671] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - No protection is provided in port.
[줄 2672] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - Although the initial cost is high, these systems are claimed to be more flexible, to have a longer life, to reduce significantly hull maintenance, and to weigh less than the sacrificial anode systems.
[줄 2673] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Care is required in their use in port alongside ships or other unprotected steel structures.
[줄 2674] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Protective coatings Paints intended to protect against corrosion consist of pigment dispersed in a liquid referred to as the 'vehicle'.
[줄 2675] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - When spread out thinly the vehicle changes in time to an adherent dry film.
[줄 2676] [91.7%] (11/12) ✅ 유지 - The drying may take place through one of the following processes: 1.
[줄 2677] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - When the vehicle consists of solid resinous material dissolved in a volatile solvent, the latter evaporates after application of the paint, leaving a dry film.
[줄 2678] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - A liquid like linseed oil as a constituent of the vehicle may produce a dry paint film by reacting chemically with the surrounding air.
[줄 2679] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - A chemical reaction may occur between the constituents of the vehicle after application, to produce a dry paint film.
[줄 2680] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - The reactive ingredients may be separated in two containers and mixed before application.
[줄 2681] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Alternatively, ingredients that only react at higher temperatures may be selected, or the reactants may be diluted with a solvent so that the reaction occurs only slowly in the can.
[줄 2682] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - Corrosion-inhibiting paints for application to steel have the following vehicle types: 1 Bitumen or pitch.
[줄 2683] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Simple solutions of bitumen or pitch are available in solvent naphtha or white spirit.
[줄 2684] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The bitumen or pitch may also be blended by heat with other materials to form a vehicle.
[줄 2685] [92.9%] (13/14) ✅ 유지 - These consist mainly of vegetable drying oils, such as linseed oil and tung oil.
[줄 2686] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - To accelerate the drying by the natural reaction with oxygen, driers are added.

[줄 2722] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Some of these resins may react with the oil to give a faster-drying vehicle.
[줄 2723] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Other resins do not react with the oil but heat is applied to dissolve the resin and cause the oil to body.
[줄 2724] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - These vehicles provide a further improvement in the drying time and filmforming properties of drying oils.
[줄 2725] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - The name alkyd arises from the ingredients, alcohols and acids.
[줄 2726] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Alkyds need not be made from oil, as an oil-fatty acid or an oil-free acid may be used.
[줄 2727] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Vehicles of this type show extremely good resistance to severe conditions of exposure.
[줄 2728] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - As any number of important vehicle types come under this general heading, these are dealt with individually.
[줄 2729] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Chemicals that may be produced from petroleum and natural gas are the source of epoxy resins.
[줄 2730] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - These paints have very good adhesion, apart from their excellent chemical resistance.
[줄 2731] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - They may also have good flexibility and toughness where co-reacting resins are introduced.
[줄 2732] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Epoxy resins are expensive owing to the removal of unwanted side products during their manufacture, and the gloss finish may tend to 'chalk', making it unsuitable for many external decorative finishes.
[줄 2733] [97.1%] (34/35) ✅ 유지 - These paints often consist of a 'two-pack' formulation, a solution of epoxy resin together with a solution of cold curing agent, such as an amine or a polyamide resin, being mixed prior to application.
[줄 2734] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - The mixed paint has a relatively slow curing rate at temperatures below 10  C Epoxy resin paints should not be confused with epoxy-ester paints, which are unsuitable for underwater use.
[줄 2735] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Epoxy-ester paints can be considered as alkyd equivalents, as they are usually made with epoxy resins and oil-fatty acids.
[줄 2736] [100.0%] (4/4) ✅ 유지 - Coal tar/epoxy resin.
[줄 2737] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - This vehicle type is similar to the epoxy resin vehicle except that, as a two-pack product, a grade of coal tar pitch is blended with the resin.
[줄 2738] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - A formulation of this type combines to some extent the chemical resistance of the epoxy resin with the impermeability of coal tar.
[줄 2739] [80.0%] (4/5) ✅ 유지 - Chlorinated rubber and isomerized rubber.
[줄 2740] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The vehicle in this case consists of a solution of plasticized chlorinated rubber, or isomerized rubber.
[줄 2741] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - Isomerized rubber is produced chemically from natural rubber, and it has the same chemical composition but a different molecular structure.
[줄 2742] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Both these derivatives of natural rubber have a wide range of solubility in organic solvents, and so allow a vehicle of higher solid content.
[줄 2743] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - On drying, the film thickness is greater than would be obtained if natural rubber were used.
[줄 2744] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - High build coatings of this type are available, thickening or thixotropic agents being added to produce a paint that can be applied in much thicker coats.
[줄 2745] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Coats of this type are particularly resistant to attack from acids and alkalis.
[줄 2746] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - A reaction between isocyanates and hydroxyl-containing compounds produces 'urethane' and this reaction has been adapted to produce polymeric compounds from which paint film, fibers, and adhesives may be obtained.
[줄 2747] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - Paint films so produced have received considerable attention in recent years, and since there is a variety of isocyanate reactions, both one- and two-pack polyurethane paints are available.
[줄 2748] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - These paints have many good properties: toughness, hardness, gloss, abrasion resistance, as well as chemical and weather resistance.
[줄 2749] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Polyurethanes are not used underwater on steel ships, only on superstructures etc. but they are very popular on yachts, where their good gloss is appreciated.
[줄 2750] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Vinyl resins are obtained by the polymerization of organic compounds containing the vinyl group.
[줄 2751] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The solids content of these paints is low; therefore, the dry film is thin and more coats are required than for most paints.
[줄 2752] [94.4%] (17/18) ✅ 유지 - As vinyl resin paints have poor adhesion to bare steel surfaces they are generally applied over a pretreatment
[줄 2753] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Vinyl paint systems are among the most effective for the underwater protection of steel.
[줄 2754] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - Paints containing metallic zinc as a pigment in sufficient quantity to ensure electrical conductivity through the dry paint film to the steel are capable of protecting the steel cathodically.
[줄 2755] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - The pigment content of the dry paint film should be greater than 90%, the vehicle being an epoxy resin, chlorinated rubber, or similar medium.
[줄 2756] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Corrosion protection by means of paints It is often assumed that all paint coatings prevent attack on the metal covered simply by excluding the corrosive agency, whether air or water.
[줄 2757] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - This is often the main and sometimes only form of protection; however, there are many paints that afford protection even though they present a porous surface or contain various discontinuities.
[줄 2758] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - For example, certain pigments in paints confer protection on steel even where it is exposed at a discontinuity.
[줄 2759] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - If the reactions at the anode and cathode of the corrosion cell that form positive and negative ions respectively are inhibited, protection is afforded.
[줄 2760] [88.0%] (22/25) ✅ 유지 - Good examples of pigments of this type are red lead and zinc chromate, red lead being an anodic inhibitor and zinc chromate a cathodic inhibitor.
[줄 2761] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - A second mode of protection occurs at gaps where the paint is richly pigmented with a metal anodic to the basis metal.
[줄 2762] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Zinc dust is a commercially available pigment that fulfills this requirement for coating steel in a salt water environment.
[줄 2763] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - The zinc dust is the sacrificial anode with respect to the steel.
[줄 2764] [97.6%] (40/41) ✅ 유지 - Antifouling systems The immersed hull and fittings of a ship at sea, particularly in coastal waters, are subject to algae, barnacle, mussel, and other shellfish growth that can impair its hydrodynamic performance and adversely affect the service of the immersed fittings.
[줄 2765] [92.9%] (26/28) ✅ 유지 - Fittings such as cooling water intake systems are often protected by impressed current antifouling systems, and immersed hulls today are finished with very effective self-polishing antifouling paints.
[줄 2766] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - Impressed current antifouling systems The functional principle of these systems is the establishment of an artificially triggered voltage difference between copper anodes and the integrated steel plate cathodes.
[줄 2767] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This causes a minor electrical current to flow from the copper anodes, so that they are dissolved to a certain degree.
[줄 2768] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - A control unit makes sure that the anodes add the required minimum amount of copper particles to the sea water, thus ensuring the formation of copper oxide that creates ambient conditions precluding local fouling.
[줄 2769] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - A control unit can be connected to the management system of the vessel.
[줄 2770] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - Using information from the management system, the impressed current antifouling system can determine the amount of copper that needs to be dissolved to give optimum performance with minimum wastage of the anodes.
[줄 2771] [92.0%] (23/25) ✅ 유지 - Antifouling paints Antifouling paints consist of a vehicle with pigments that give body and color together with materials toxic to marine vegetable and animal growth.
[줄 2772] [90.9%] (10/11) ✅ 유지 - Copper is the best known toxin used in traditional antifouling paints.
[줄 2773] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - To prolong the useful life of the paint the toxic compounds must dissolve slowly in sea water.
[줄 2774] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Once the release rate falls below a level necessary to prevent settlement of marine organisms, the antifouling composition is no longer effective.
[줄 2775] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - On merchant ships the effective period for traditional compositions was about 12 months.
[줄 2776] [90.6%] (29/32) ✅ 유지 - Demands in particular from large tanker owners wishing to reduce very high docking costs led to specially developed antifouling compositions with an effective life up to 24 months in the early 1970s.
[줄 2777] [96.9%] (31/32) ✅ 유지 - Subsequent developments of constant emission organic toxin antifoulings having a leaching rate independent of exposure time saw the paint technologists by chance discover coatings that also tended to become smoother in service.
[줄 2778] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - These so-called self-polishing antifoulings, with a lifetime that is proportional to applied thickness and therefore theoretically unlimited, smooth rather than roughen with time and result in reduced friction drag.
[줄 2779] [90.2%] (46/51) ✅ 유지 - Though more expensive than their traditional counterparts, given the claim that each 10-micron increase in hull roughness can result in a 1% increase in fuel consumption, their selfpolishing characteristic as well as their longer effective life, up to 5 years' protection between dry dockings, made them attractive to the shipowner.
[줄 2780] [85.2%] (23/27) ✅ 유지 - The benefits of the first widely used self-polishing copolymer antifouling paints could be traced to the properties of their prime ingredients, the tributyltin compounds or TBTs.
[줄 2781] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - TBTs were extremely active against a wide range of fouling organisms and they were able to be chemically bonded to the acrylic backbone of the paint system.
[줄 2782] [94.4%] (34/36) ✅ 유지 - When immersed in sea water a specific chemical reaction took place that cleaved the TBT from the paint backbone, resulting in both controlled release of the TBT and controlled disappearance or polishing of the paint film.
[줄 2783] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - Unfortunately, it was found that the small concentrations of TBTs released, particularly in enclosed coastal waters, had a harmful effect on certain marine organisms.
[줄 2784] [89.2%] (33/37) ✅ 유지 - This led to the banning of TBT antifouling paints for pleasure boats and smaller commercial ships in many developed countries and the introduction of regulations limiting the release rate of TBT for antifouling paints on larger ships.
[줄 2785] [76.9%] (30/39) ✅ 유지 - The International Convention on the Control of Harmful Antifouling on Ships, 2001 subsequently required that: 1 Ships shall not apply or reapply organotin compounds that act as biocides in antifouling systems on or after 1 January 2003; and 2.
[줄 2786] [76.9%] (10/13) ✅ 유지 - No ship shall have organotin compounds that act as biocides in antifouling systems.
[줄 2787] [80.0%] (8/10) ✅ 유지 - The final phase-out of TBT paints was in 2008.
[줄 2788] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - In theory, ships could retain the paint if it was sealed under another coating but in practice TBTs are no longer at sea.
[줄 2789] [97.0%] (32/33) ✅ 유지 - Note: Organotin means an organic compound with one or more tin atoms in its molecules used as a pesticide, hitherto considered to decompose safely, now found to be toxic in the food chain.
[줄 2790] [90.0%] (9/10) ✅ 유지 - A biocide is a chemical capable of killing living organisms.
[줄 2791] [92.5%] (37/40) ✅ 유지 - Antifouling paints subsequently applied have generally focused on either the use of copper-based self-polishing antifouling products, which operate in a similar manner to the banned TBT products, or the use of the so-called low-surface-energy coatings.
[줄 2792] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - The latter coatings do not polish or contain booster biocides, instead they offer a very smooth, low-surface-energy surface to which it is difficult for fouling to adhere.
[줄 2793] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - When the vessel is at rest some fouling may occur but once it is underway and reaches a critical speed the fouling is released.
[줄 2794] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Painting ships To obtain the optimum performance from paints it is important that the metal surfaces are properly prepared before application of paints and subsequently maintained as such throughout the fabrication and erection process.
[줄 2795] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Paints tailored for the service conditions of the structure to which they apply, and recommended as such by the manufacturer, only should be applied.
[줄 2796] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - It is common, especially for ships undergoing a regular dry-docking, for the coating process to be specified and managed by the coating supplier.
[줄 2797] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Surface preparation Good surface preparation is essential to successful painting, the primary cause of many paint failures being the inadequacy of the initial material preparation.
[줄 2798] [92.9%] (13/14) ✅ 유지 - It is particularly important before painting new steel that any millscale should be removed.
[줄 2799] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Millscale is a thin layer of iron oxides that forms on the steel surface during hot rolling of the plates and sections.
[줄 2800] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Not only does the non-uniform millscale set up corrosion cells, as illustrated previously, but it may also come away from the surface removing any paint film applied over it.
[줄 2801] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Any corrosion from storage of the steel outdoors in a stockyard must also be removed.
[줄 2802] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - It is also important to create a good surface for coating.
[줄 2803] [83.3%] (15/18) ✅ 유지 - Swedish standards are often quoted, SA 3 being white metal and SA 2.5 being near white metal.
[줄 2804] [75.0%] (9/12) ✅ 유지 - SA 2.5 is common as a reasonably achieveable standard for shipyards.
[줄 2805] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - The surface is clean and the blasting process also provides a 'key' with very small indentations to which the coating adheres well.
[줄 2806] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The most common methods employed to prepare steel surfaces for painting are: Blast cleaning Pickling Flame cleaning Preparation by hand High-pressure water blasting.
[줄 2807] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Blast cleaning is the most efficient method for preparing the surface and is in common use in all large shipyards.
[줄 2808] [90.0%] (9/10) ✅ 유지 - The shipyard preparation process has been outlined in Chapter 13.
[줄 2809] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Smaller shipyards, where the quantity of steel processed does not justify the capital investment in the preparation equipment, usually buy steel already prepared from a steel mill or stockist.
[줄 2810] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Following the blast cleaning it is desirable to brush the surface and apply a coat of priming paint as soon as possible, since the metal is liable to rust rapidly.
[줄 2811] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - There are two main types of blasting equipment available, an impeller wheel plant where the abrasive is thrown at high velocity against the metal surface, and a nozzle type where a jet of abrasive impinges on the metal surface.
[줄 2812] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The latter type should preferably be fitted with vacuum recovery equipment, rather than allow the spent abrasive and dust to be discharged to atmosphere, as is often the case in ship repair work.
[줄 2813] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Impeller wheel plants that are self-contained and collect the dust and recirculate the clean abrasive are generally fitted within the shipbuilding shops.
[줄 2814] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Steel shot is the preferred blast medium for preparation of steel plates and profiles for new construction.
[줄 2815] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - As the process proceeds the shot is recovered and reused.
[줄 2816] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The shot breaks down during the blasting and a mix of new and broken shot provides good surface preparation.
[줄 2817] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - Dust and other debris is filtered out of the recovery system for disposal.
[줄 2818] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Cast iron and steel grit may be used for the abrasive, also copper slag, but nonmetallic abrasives are also available.
[줄 2819] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Grit has been used in ship repair but is becoming much less popular because of environmental issues associated with disposal of the waste material.
[줄 2820] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The use of sand is prohibited in most countries because the fine dust produced may cause silicosis.
[줄 2821] [92.6%] (25/27) ✅ 유지 - Pickling involves the immersion of the metal in an acid solution, usually hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, in order to remove the millscale and rust from the surface.
[줄 2822] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - After immersion in these acids the metal will require a thorough hot water rinse.
[줄 2823] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - It is preferable that the treatment is followed by application of a priming coat.
[줄 2824] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Pickling is no longer found in most of the ship construction industry.
[줄 2825] [93.3%] (14/15) ✅ 유지 - Using an oxyacetylene flame the millscale and rust may be removed from a steel surface.
[줄 2826] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - The process does not entirely remove the millscale and rust, but it can be quite useful for cleaning plates under inclement weather conditions, the flame drying out the plate.
[줄 2827] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Flame, or another heating process, is used as part of an automated preparation line in a shipyard, to preheat the steel, which assists the cleaning and drying of the primer paint coating.
[줄 2828] [94.3%] (33/35) ✅ 유지 - Hand cleaning by various forms of wire brush is often not very satisfactory, and would only be used where the millscale has been loosened by weathering, i.e exposure to atmosphere over a long period.
[줄 2829] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - For ships in service hand cleaning may be used for very small corroded areas.
[줄 2830] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - High-pressure water blasting is superseding grit blasting for ship repair.
[줄 2831] [90.5%] (19/21) ✅ 유지 - It is capable of restoring a steel surface to SA 2.5, provided any corrosion has not been allowed to develop.
[줄 2832] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Disposal of the waste material, in this case mainly water, is a main reason for the adoption of water blasting.
[줄 2833] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Blast cleaning using shot or grit is preferred for best results and economy in shipbuilding, it is essential prior to application of high-performance paint systems used today.
[줄 2834] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Pickling, which also gives good results, can be expensive and less applicable to production schemes; flame cleaning is much less effective; and hand cleaning gives the worst results.
[줄 2835] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - Water blasting is mainly a ship repair process.
[줄 2836] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Temporary paint protection during building After the steel is blast cleaned it may be several months before it is built into the ship and finally painted.
[줄 2837] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - It is desirable to protect the material against rusting in this period as the final paint will offer the best protection when applied over perfectly clean steel.
[줄 2838] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The formulation of a prefabrication primer for immediate application after blasting must meet a number of requirements.
[줄 2839] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - It should dry rapidly to permit handling of the plates within a few minutes and working the plates within a day or so.
[줄 2840] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - It should be nontoxic, and it should not produce harmful porosity in welds nor give off obnoxious fumes during welding or cutting.
[줄 2841] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - For some high-speed welding processes it is necessary to remove the primer in way of the welds to avoid porosity.
[줄 2842] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - After cutting and welding, areas of damaged primer are usually strip coated by hand to cover the affected steel and retain the primer protection against corrosion.
[줄 2843] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The primer must also be compatible with any subsequent paint finishes to be applied.
[줄 2844] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Satisfactory formulations are available, for example a primer consisting of zinc dust in an epoxy resin.
[줄 2845] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Some shipyards where work is entirely undercover and where the steel is used quickly may dispense with primer.
[줄 2846] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Given the sophistication and cost of modern, long-life coatings, their application is critical to performance.
[줄 2847] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - It is common for shipyards to take complete units and blocks, once all the hot work is completed, for final coating in a controlled environment.
[줄 2848] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - So-called 'paint cells' are temperature- and humidity-controlled buildings.
[줄 2849] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - The units are driven into the cells using self-elevating transporters.
[줄 2850] [95.0%] (19/20) ✅ 유지 - The units are then blasted, if no primer has been used or the primer is degraded and unsuitable for overcoating.
[줄 2851] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Once cleaned the coatings can be applied in near ideal conditions.
[줄 2852] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - Hull and internal coatings are applied.
[줄 2853] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Where the units are to be joined in the building dock, unpainted areas are left.
[줄 2854] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - These are completed after the hull welding, using localized protection from unsuitable weather conditions.
[줄 2855] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Paint systems on ships The paint system applied to any part of a ship will be dictated by the environment to which that part of the structure is exposed.
[줄 2856] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Traditionally, the painting of the external ship structure was divided into three regions: 1 Below the waterline, where the plates are continually immersed in sea water.
[줄 2857] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - The waterline or boot topping region, where immersion is intermittent and a lot of abrasion occurs.
[줄 2858] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The topsides and superstructure exposed to an atmosphere laden with salt spray, and subject to damage through cargo handling.
[줄 2859] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - However, now that tougher paints are used for the ship's bottom the distinction between regions need not be so well defined, one scheme covering the bottom and waterline regions.
[줄 2860] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Internally, by far the greatest problem is the provision of coatings for various liquid cargo and salt water ballast tanks.
[줄 2861] [90.9%] (20/22) ✅ 유지 - Below the waterline The ship's bottom has priming coats of corrosion-inhibiting paint applied that are followed by an antifouling paint.
[줄 2862] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Paints used for steels immersed in sea water are required to resist alkaline conditions.
[줄 2863] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - The reason for this is that an iron alloy immersed in a sodium chloride solution having the necessary supply of dissolved oxygen gives rise to corrosion cells with caustic soda produced at the cathodes.
[줄 2864] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Further, the paint should have a good electrical resistance so that the flow of corrosion currents between the steel and sea water is limited.
[줄 2865] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - These requirements make the standard nonmarine structural steel primer red lead in linseed oil unsuitable for ship use below the waterline.
[줄 2866] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Suitable corrosion-inhibiting paints for ships' bottoms are pitch or bitumen types, chlorinated rubber, coal tar/epoxy resin, or vinyl resin paints.
[줄 2867] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - The antifouling paints may be applied after the corrosion-inhibiting coatings and should not come into direct contact with the steel hull, since the toxic compounds present may cause corrosion.
[줄 2868] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Waterline or boot topping region Generally, modern practice requires a complete paint system for the hull above the waterline.
[줄 2869] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - This may be based on vinyl and alkyd resins or on polyurethane resin paints.
[줄 2870] [90.9%] (10/11) ✅ 유지 - Superstructures Red lead- or zinc chromate-based primers are commonly used.
[줄 2871] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - White finishing paints are then used extensively for superstructures.
[줄 2872] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - These are usually oleo-resinous or alkyd paints that may be based on 'nonyellowing' oils, linseed oil-based paints that yellow on exposure being avoided on modern ships.
[줄 2873] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Where aluminum alloy superstructures are fitted, under no circumstance should lead-based paints be applied; zinc chromate paints are generally supplied for application to aluminum.
[줄 2874] [97.1%] (34/35) ✅ 유지 - Cargo and ballast tanks Severe corrosion may occur in a ship's cargo tanks as the combined result of carrying liquid cargoes and sea water ballast, with warm or cold sea water cleaning between voyages.
[줄 2875] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - This is particularly true of oil tankers.
[줄 2876] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Tankers carrying 'white oil' cargoes suffer more general corrosion than those carrying crude oils, which deposit a film on the tank surface, providing some protection against corrosion.
[줄 2877] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The latter type may, however, experience severe local pitting corrosion due to the non-uniformity of the deposited film, and subsequent corrosion of any bare plate when sea water ballast is carried.
[줄 2878] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Epoxy resin paints are used extensively within these tanks, and vinyl resins and zinc-rich coatings may also be used.

[줄 3359] [93.5%] (43/46) ✅ 유지 - Classi fi cation of ships operating in ice Classification societies such as Lloyd's Register and a number of administrations whose waters experience icing have for many years had regulations defining and categorizing ice conditions and specifying design and standard requirements for ships operating in ice.
[줄 3360] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's Register have assigned special features notations to many existing ships for operation in first-year ice and for operation in multi-year ice.
[줄 3361] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Firstyear ice notations are for additional strengthening where waters ice up in winter only and multi-year ice for service in Arctic and Antarctic waters.
[줄 3362] [95.5%] (64/67) ✅ 유지 - The increasing maritime trading within Arctic waters in the past decade and the desire to ship oil, gas, and other commodities from there all year round appears to have resulted in the class societies adopting to some extent the ice strengthening requirements of the 'Finnish–Swedish Ice Class Rules 1985' developed for vessels trading in winter and for which the keel was laid after 1 November 1986.
[줄 3363] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - These requirements were intended primarily for vessels operating in the Northern Baltic in winter are given for four different ice classes:
[줄 3364] [85.0%] (34/40) ✅ 유지 - Ice Class 1AA Ice Class 1A Ice Class 1B Ice Class 1C The hull scantling requirements determined under these rules are based on certain assumptions concerning the nature of the ice load the ship's structure may be subjected to.
[줄 3365] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - These assumptions have been determined from full-scale observations made in the Northern Baltic.
[줄 3366] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - This increased trading in Arctic waters has also created particular interest in the establishment of universal requirements for ships operating in ice.
[줄 3367] [87.5%] (28/32) ✅ 유지 - Both the IMO and IACS have been involved in this work, with the IMO producing guidelines in December 2002 for shipsoperatingin Arctic ice-covered waters forwhich they prescribe seven 'Polar Class' descriptions.
[줄 3368] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - These range from PC 1 for year-round operation in all Arctic ice covered waters to PC 7 for summer/autumn operation in thin first-year ice that may include old ice inclusions.
[줄 3369] [92.0%] (23/25) ✅ 유지 - Subsequently, the IACS set up a working group to develop Unified Requirements for Polar Ships that would cover: a Polar class descriptions and applications b.
[줄 3370] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Structural requirements for Polar class ships c Machinery requirements for Polar class ships.
[줄 3371] [95.1%] (39/41) ✅ 유지 - It was intended that with the completion of these Uniform Requirements for Polar Ships and their adoption by the IACS Council, the IACS member societies will have one year in which to implement these common standards for ships operating in ice.
[줄 3372] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Structural design programs In recent years the principal classification societies have developed software packages for use by shipyards that incorporate dynamic-based criteria for the scantlings
[줄 3373] [90.5%] (38/42) ✅ 유지 - The authors are grateful to the following firms and organizations who were kind enough to provide information and drawings from which material for the book was extracted: Appledore Shipbuilders Ltd Blohm and Voss, A.G British Maritime Technology British Oxygen Co Ltd

[줄 3452] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - The production of all steels used for shipbuilding purposes starts with the smelting of iron ore and the making of pig-iron.
[줄 3453] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Normally the iron ore is smelted in a blast furnace, which is a large, slightly conical structure lined with a refractory material.
[줄 3454] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - To provide the heat for smelting, coke is used and limestone is also added.
[줄 3455] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This makes the slag formed by the incombustible impurities in the iron ore fluid, so that it can be drawn off.
[줄 3456] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Air necessary for combustion is blown in through a ring of holes near the bottom, and the coke, ore, and limestone are charged into the top of the furnace in rotation.
[줄 3457] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - Molten metal may be drawn off at intervals from a hole or spout at the bottom of the furnace and run into molds formed in a bed of sand or into metal molds.
[줄 3458] [88.2%] (15/17) ✅ 유지 - The resultant pig-iron contains 92–97% iron, the remainder being carbon, silicon, manganese, sulfur, and phosphorus.
[줄 3459] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - In the subsequent manufacture of steels the pigiron is refined; in other words the impurities are reduced.

[줄 3462] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - Each item of information may be considered in more detail, together with any restraints placed on these items by the ship's service or other factors outside the designer's control.
[줄 3463] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - The dimensions of most ships are primarily influenced by the cargo-carrying capacity of the vessel.
[줄 3464] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - In the case of the passenger vessel, dimensions are influenced by the height and length of superstructure containing the accommodation.
[줄 3465] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Length, where not specified as a maximum, should be a minimum consistent with the required speed and hull form.
[줄 3466] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Increase of length produces higher longitudinal bending stresses requiring additional strengthening and a greater displacement for the same cargo weight.
[줄 3467] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - Breadth may be such as to provide adequate transverse stability.
[줄 3468] [93.5%] (43/46) ✅ 유지 - A minimum depth is controlled by the draft plus statutory freeboard, but an increase in depth will result in a reduction of the longitudinal bending stresses, providing an increase in strength, or allowing a reduction in scantlings i.e plate thickness/size of stiffening members etc..
[줄 3469] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - Increased depth is therefore preferred to increased length.
[줄 3470] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Draft is often limited by area of operation, but if it can be increased to give a greater depth this can be an advantage.
[줄 3471] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Many vessels are required to make passages through various canals and straits and pass under bridges within enclosed waters, and this will place a limitation on their dimensions.
[줄 3472] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - For example, locks in the Panama Canal and St Lawrence Seaway limit length, breadth, and draft.
[줄 3473] [89.2%] (33/37) ✅ 유지 - At the time of writing, the Malacca Straits main shipping channel is about 25 meters deep and the Suez Canal could accommodate ships with a beam of up to 75 meters and maximum draft of 16 metres.
[줄 3474] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - A maximum air draft on container ships of around 40 meters is very close to clear the heights of the Gerard Desmond Bridge, Long Beach, California and Bayonne Bridge, New York.
[줄 3475] [89.5%] (17/19) ✅ 유지 - Newer bridges over the Suez Canal at 65 meters and over the Bosporus at 62 meters provide greater clearance.
[줄 3476] [87.5%] (7/8) ✅ 유지 - Displacement is made up of lightweight plus deadweight.
[줄 3477] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - The lightweight is the weight of vessel as built and ready for sea.
[줄 3478] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - Deadweight is the difference between the lightweight and loaded displacement, i.e it is the weight of cargo plus weights of fuel, stores, water ballast, fresh water, crew and passengers, and baggage.
[줄 3479] [91.3%] (21/23) ✅ 유지 - When carrying high-density cargoes e.g ore it is desirable to keep the lightweight as small as possible, consistent with adequate strength.
[줄 3480] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Since only cargo weight of the total deadweight is earning capital, other items should be kept to a minimum as long as the vessel fulfills its commitments.
[줄 3481] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - In determining the dimensions, statical stability is kept in mind in order to ensure that this is sufficient in all possible conditions of loading.
[줄 3482] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - Beam and depth are the main influences.
[줄 3483] [88.2%] (15/17) ✅ 유지 - Statutory freeboard and sheer are important together with the weight distribution in arranging the vessel's layout.
[줄 3484] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Adequate propulsive performance will ensure that the vessel attains the required speeds.
[줄 3485] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - The hull form is such that economically it offers a minimum resistance to motion so that a minimum power with economically lightest machinery is installed without losing the specified cargo capacity.
[줄 3486] [87.9%] (29/33) ✅ 유지 - Manufacture of steels Steels may be broadly considered as alloys of iron and carbon, the carbon percentage varying from about 0.1% in mild steels to about 1.8% in some hardened steels.
[줄 3487] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - These may be produced by one of four different processes: the open hearth process, the Bessemer converter process, the electric furnace process, or an oxygen process.
[줄 3488] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Processes may be either an acid or basic process according to the chemical nature of the slag produced.
[줄 3489] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Acid processes are used to refine pig-iron low in phosphorus and sulfur that are rich in silicon and therefore produce an acid slag.
[줄 3490] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The furnace lining is constructed of an acid material so that it will prevent a reaction with the slag.
[줄 3491] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - A basic process is used to refine pig-iron that is rich in phosphorus and low in silicon.
[줄 3492] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Phosphorus can be removed only by introducing a large amount of lime, which produces a basic slag.
[줄 3493] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The furnace lining must then be of a basic refractory to prevent a reaction with the slag.
[줄 3494] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - About 85% of all steel produced in Britain is of the basic type, and with modern techniques is almost as good as the acid steels produced with superior ores.
[줄 3495] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Only the open hearth, electric furnace, and oxygen processes are described here as the Bessemer converter process is not used for shipbuilding steels.
[줄 3496] [91.3%] (21/23) ✅ 유지 - Open hearth process The open hearth furnace is capable of producing large quantities of steel, handling 150–300 tonnes in a single melt.
[줄 3497] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - It consists of a shallow bath, roofed in, and set above two brick-lined heating chambers.
[줄 3498] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - At the ends are openings for heated air and fuel to be introduced into the furnace.
[줄 3499] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Also, these permit the escape of the burned gas, which is used for heating the air and fuel.
[줄 3500] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Every 20 minutes or so the flow of air and fuel is reversed.
[줄 3501] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - In this process a mixture of pig-iron and steel scrap is melted in the furnace, carbon and the impurities being oxidized.
[줄 3502] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Oxidization is produced by the oxygen present in the iron oxide of the pig-iron.
[줄 3503] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Subsequently carbon, manganese, and other elements are added to eliminate iron oxides and give the required chemical composition.
[줄 3504] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Electric furnaces Electric furnaces are generally of two types: the arc furnace and the high-frequency induction furnace.
[줄 3505] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The former is used for refining a charge to give the required composition, whereas the latter may only be used for melting down a charge whose composition is similar to that finally required.
[줄 3506] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - For this reason only the arc furnace is considered in any detail.
[줄 3507] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - In an arc furnace melting is produced by striking an arc between electrodes suspended from the roof of the furnace and the charge itself in the hearth of the furnace.
[줄 3508] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - A charge consists of pig-iron and steel scrap, and the process enables consistent results to be obtained and the final composition of the steel can be accurately controlled.
[줄 3509] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Electric furnace processes are often used for the production of high-grade alloy steels.
[줄 3510] [96.6%] (28/29) ✅ 유지 - Oxygen process This is a modern steelmaking process by which a molten charge of pig-iron and steel scrap with alloying elements is contained in a basic lined converter.
[줄 3511] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - A jet of highpurity gaseous oxygen is then directed onto the surface of the liquid metal in order to refine it.
[줄 3512] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Steel from the open hearth or electric furnace is tapped into large ladles and poured into ingot molds.
[줄 3513] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - It is allowed to cool in these molds until it becomes reasonably solidified, permitting it to be transferred to 'soaking pits' where the ingot is reheated to the required temperature for rolling.
[줄 3514] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Chemical additions to steels Additions of chemical elements to steels during the above processes serve several purposes.
[줄 3515] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - They may be used to deoxidize the metal, to remove impurities and bring them out into the slag, and finally to bring about the desired composition.
[줄 3516] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The amount of deoxidizing elements added determines whether the steels are 'rimmed steels' or 'killed steels'.
[줄 3517] [94.1%] (16/17) ✅ 유지 - Rimmed steels are produced when only small additions of deoxidizing material are added to the molten metal.
[줄 3518] [77.8%] (14/18) ✅ 유지 - Only those steels having less than 0.2% carbon and less than 0.6% manganese can be rimmed.
[줄 3519] [96.4%] (27/28) ✅ 유지 - Owing to the absence of deoxidizing material, the oxygen in the steel combines with the carbon and other gases present and a large volume of gas is liberated.
[줄 3520] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - So long as the metal is molten, the gas passes upwards through the molten metal.
[줄 3521] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - When solidification takes place in ingot form, initially from the sides and bottom and then across the top, the gases can no longer leave the metal.
[줄 3522] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - In the central portion of the ingot a large quantity of gas is trapped, with the result that the core of the rimmed ingot is a mass of blow holes.
[줄 3523] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Normally the hot rolling of the ingot into thin sheet is sufficient to weld the surfaces of the blow holes together, but this material is unsuitable for thicker plate.
[줄 3524] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The term 'killed' steel indicates that the metal has solidified in the ingot mold with little or no evolution of gas.

[줄 3529] [97.7%] (42/43) ✅ 유지 - The melting points of impurities like sulfides and phosphides in the steel are lower than that of the pure metal and these will tend to separate out and collect towards the center and top of the ingot, which is the last to solidify.
[줄 3530] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - This forms what is known as the 'segregate' in the way of the noticeable contraction at the top of the ingot.
[줄 3531] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Owing to the high concentration of impurities at this point, this portion of the ingot is often discarded prior to rolling plate and sections.
[줄 3532] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Heat treatment of steels The properties of steels may be altered greatly by the heat treatment to which the steel is subsequently subjected.

[줄 3535] [90.3%] (28/31) ✅ 유지 - Annealing This consists of heating the steel at a slow rate to a temperature of say 850–950  C, and then cooling it in the furnace at a very slow rate.
[줄 3536] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - The objects of annealing are to relieve any internal stresses, to soften the steel, or to bring the steel to a condition suitable for a subsequent heat treatment.
[줄 3537] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Normalizing This is carried out by heating the steel slowly to a temperature similar to that for annealing and allowing it to cool in air.
[줄 3538] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - The resulting faster cooling rate produces a harder, stronger steel than annealing, and also refines the grain size.
[줄 3539] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - Steel is heated to temperatures similar to that for annealing and normalizing, and then quenched in water or oil.
[줄 3540] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - The fast cooling rate produces a very hard structure with a higher tensile strength.
[줄 3541] [93.5%] (29/31) ✅ 유지 - Tempering Quenched steels may be further heated to a temperature somewhat between atmospheric and 680  C, and some alloy steels are then cooled fairly rapidly by quenching in oil or water.

[줄 3613] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum alloy There are three advantages that aluminum alloys have over mild steel in the construction of ships.
[줄 3614] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Firstly, aluminum is lighter than mild steel, and with an aluminum structure it has been suggested that up to 60% of the weight of a steel structure may be saved.
[줄 3615] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - This is in fact the principal advantage as far as merchant ships are concerned, the other two advantages of aluminum being a high resistance to corrosion and its nonmagnetic properties.
[줄 3616] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The nonmagnetic properties can have advantages in warships and locally in the way of the magnetic compass, but they are generally of little importance in merchant vessels.
[줄 3617] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Good corrosion properties can be utilized, but correct maintenance procedures and careful insulation from the adjoining steel structure are necessary.
[줄 3618] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - A major disadvantage of the use of aluminum alloys is their higher initial and fabrication costs.
[줄 3619] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - The higher costs must be offset by an increased earning capacity of the vessel, resulting from a reduced lightship weight or increased passenger accommodation on the same ship dimensions.
[줄 3620] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Experience with large passenger liners on the North Atlantic service has indicated that maintenance costs of aluminum alloy structures can be higher for this type of ship and service.
[줄 3621] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - Although aluminum was first used for small craft in 1891 and for experimental naval vessels in 1894, it has not been a significant material for ships until comparatively recently.
[줄 3622] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - A significant number of larger ships have been fitted with superstructures of aluminum alloy and, apart from the resulting reduction in displacement, benefits have been obtained in improving the transverse stability.

[줄 3625] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - superstructure is at a position above the ship's center of gravity, this ensures a lower center of gravity than that obtained with a comparable steel structure.
[줄 3626] [97.6%] (41/42) ✅ 유지 - For example, on the Queen Elizabeth 2 with a limited beam to transit the Panama Canal, the top five decks constructed of aluminum alloy enabled the ship to support one more deck than would have been possible with an all-steel construction.
[줄 3627] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Only in those vessels having a fairly high speed and hence power, also ships where the deadweight/lightweight ratio is low, are appreciable savings to be expected.
[줄 3628] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Such ships are moderate- and high-speed passenger liners having a low deadweight.
[줄 3629] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - It is interesting to note, however, that for the Queen Mary 2, not having a beam limitation, the owners decided to avoid aluminum alloy as far as possible to ensure ease of maintenance over a life cycle of 40 years.
[줄 3630] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - A very small number of cargo liners have been fitted with an aluminum alloy superstructure, principally to clear a fixed draft over a river bar with maximum cargo.
[줄 3631] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Smaller naval vessels have often had aluminum superstructures on a steel hull as a weight saving measure.
[줄 3632] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - A difficulty is the joining of the two metals, in such a way as to avoid a corrosion cell being set up.
[줄 3633] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Either bolted connections with washers to separate the two metals, or an explosively bonded steel/aluminum transition piece can be used.
[줄 3634] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - In the explosively bonded material the interface between the metals remains corrosion free.
[줄 3635] [100.0%] (47/47) ✅ 유지 - The total construction in aluminum alloy of a large ship is not considered an economic proposition and it is only in the construction of smaller multi-hull and other high-speed craft where aluminum alloys of higher strength-to-weight ratio are fully used to good advantage.
[줄 3636] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum has been used for specialized craft, including hydrofoils, and is currently particularly used for high-speed ferries where weight is critical.
[줄 3637] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - The material is also used for small, high-speed military vessels.
[줄 3638] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - One advantage of aluminum is that the material can be extruded to produce a very wide range of profiles.
[줄 3639] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - These can have benefits in design of efficient structures.
[줄 3640] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - An example is a plate that is extruded with stiffeners as part of the profile.
[줄 3641] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The plates can be joined to assemble deck panels, with minimum welding and hence a lower risk of distortion.
[줄 3642] [100.0%] (6/6) ✅ 유지 - The production process is also faster.
[줄 3643] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Specialized extrusions can be expensive so the economic benefits have to be considered carefully.
[줄 3644] [94.7%] (18/19) ✅ 유지 - Production of aluminum For aluminum production at the present time the ore, bauxite, is mined containing roughly 56% aluminum.
[줄 3645] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The actual extraction of the aluminum from the ore is a complicated and costly process involving two distinct stages.
[줄 3646] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Firstly, the bauxite is purified to obtain pure aluminum oxide, known as alumina; the alumina is then reduced to metallic aluminum.
[줄 3647] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - The metal is cast in pig or ingot forms and alloys are added where required before the metal is cast into billets or slabs for subsequent rolling, extrusion, or other forming operations.
[줄 3648] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - Sectional material is mostly produced by the extrusion process.
[줄 3649] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - This involves forcing a billet of the hot material through a die of the desired shape.
[줄 3650] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - More intricate shapes are produced by this method than are possible with steel, where the sections
[줄 3651] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - However, the range of thickness of section may be limited since each thickness requires a different die.
[줄 3652] [75.0%] (6/8) ✅ 유지 - Typical sections are shown in Figure 6.1.
[줄 3653] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum alloys Pure aluminum has a low tensile strength and is of little use for structural purposes; therefore, the pure metal is alloyed with small percentages of other materials to give greater tensile strengths.
[줄 3654] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - There are a number of aluminum alloys in use, but these may be separated into two distinct groups, nonheat-treated alloys and heat-treated alloys.
[줄 3655] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The latter, as implied, are subjected to a carefully controlled heating and cooling cycle in order to improve the tensile strength.
[줄 3656] [95.2%] (20/21) ✅ 유지 - Cold working of the nonheat-treated plate has the effect of strengthening the material and this can be employed to advantage.
[줄 3657] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - However, at the same time the plate becomes less ductile, and if cold working is considerable the material may crack; this places a limit on the amount of cold forming possible in ship building.
[줄 3658] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Cold-worked alloys may be subsequently subjected to a slow heating and cooling annealing or stabilizing process to improve their ductility.
[줄 3659] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - With aluminum alloys a suitable heat treatment is necessary to obtain a high tensile strength.
[줄 3660] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - A heat-treated aluminum alloy that is suitable for shipbuilding purposes is one having as its main alloying constituents magnesium and silicon.
[줄 3661] [93.3%] (28/30) ✅ 유지 - These form a compound Mg 2 Si and the resulting alloy has very good resistance to corrosion and a higher ultimate tensile strength than that of the nonheat-treated alloys.
[줄 3662] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Since the material is heat treated to achieve this increased strength, subsequent heating, for example welding or hot forming, may destroy the improved properties locally.
[줄 3663] [87.5%] (21/24) ✅ 유지 - Aluminum alloys are generally identified by their Aluminum Association numeric designation, the 5000 alloys being nonheat treated and the 6000 alloys being heat treated.

[줄 3760] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - Stress is a measure of the ability of a material to transmit a load, and the intensity of stress in the material, which is the load per unit area, is often stated.
[줄 3761] [90.0%] (54/60) ✅ 유지 - The load per unit area is simply obtained by dividing the applied load by the cross-sectional area of the material, e.g if a tensile load of P kg is applied to a rod having a cross-sectional area of A mm 2, then the tensile stress in the material of the rod is P / A kg/mm 2.
[줄 3762] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Total strain is defined as the total deformation that a body undergoes when subjected to an applied load.
[줄 3763] [86.0%] (37/43) ✅ 유지 - The strain is the deformation per unit length or unit volume, e.g if the tensile load P applied to the rod of original length l produces an elongation, or extension, of the rod of amount d l, then the tensile Ship Construction.

[줄 3766] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - It can be shown that the load on the rod may be increased uniformly and the resulting extension will also increase uniformly until a certain load is reached.
[줄 3767] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - This indicates that the load is proportional to extension, and hence stress and strain are proportional since the cross-sectional area and original length of the rod remain constant.
[줄 3768] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - For most metals this direct proportionality holds until what is known as the 'elastic limit' is reached.
[줄 3769] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The metal behaves elastically to this point, the rod for example returning to its original length if the load is removed before the 'elastic limit' is reached.
[줄 3770] [94.7%] (36/38) ✅ 유지 - If a mild steel bar is placed in a testing machine and the extensions are recorded for uniformly increasing loads, a graph of load against extension, or stress against strain, may be plotted as in Figure 7.1.

[줄 3777] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The yield stress for a metal corresponds to the stress at the 'yield point'; that is, the point at which the metal no longer behaves elastically.
[줄 3778] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Ultimate tensile stress is the maximum load to which the metal is subjected, divided by the original cross-sectional area.
[줄 3779] [94.7%] (36/38) ✅ 유지 - Beyond the yield point the metal behaves plastically, which means that the metal deforms at a greater, unproportional, rate when the yield stress is exceeded, and will not return to its original dimensions on removal of the load.
[줄 3780] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - It becomes deformed or is often said to be permanently 'set'.

[줄 3782] [94.9%] (37/39) ✅ 유지 - A 'proof stress' is quoted for the material and this may be obtained by setting off on the base some percentage of the strain, say 0.2%, and drawing a line parallel to the straight portion of the curve.
[줄 3783] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The intersection of this line with the actual stress–strain curve marks the proof stress.
[줄 3784] [97.6%] (40/41) ✅ 유지 - It is worth noting at this stage that the ship's structure is designed for working stresses that are within the elastic range and much lower than the ultimate tensile strength of the material to allow a reasonable factor of safety.
[줄 3785] [94.1%] (32/34) ✅ 유지 - Classi fi cation society tests for hull materials Both mild steel and higher tensile steel plates and sections built into a ship are to be produced at works approved by the appropriate classification society.

[줄 3835] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - which are referred to as vertical shearing forces, since they tend to shear the vertical material in the hull.
[줄 3836] [94.4%] (34/36) ✅ 유지 - The ship shown in Figure 8.1 will be loaded in a similar manner to the beam shown below it, and will tend to bend in a similar manner owing to the variation in vertical loading.
[줄 3837] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - It can be seen that the upper fibers of the beam will be in tension, as will the material forming the deck of the ship with this loading.
[줄 3838] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Conversely, the lower fibers of the beam, and likewise the material forming the bottom of the ship, will be in compression.
[줄 3839] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - A vessel bending in this manner is said to be 'hogging' and if it takes up the reverse form with excess weight amidships is said to be 'sagging'.
[줄 3840] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - When sagging the deck will be in compression and the bottom shell in tension.
[줄 3841] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - Lying in still water the vessel is subjected to bending moments either hogging and sagging depending on the relative weight and buoyancy forces, and it will also be subjected to vertical shear forces.
[줄 3842] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - Bending moments in a seaway When a ship is in a seaway the waves with their troughs and crests produce a greater variation in the buoyant forces and therefore can increase the bending moment, vertical shear force, and stresses.
[줄 3843] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Classically the extreme effects can be illustrated with the vessel balanced on a wave of length equal to that of the ship.
[줄 3844] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - If the crest of the wave is amidships the buoyancy forces will tend to 'hog' the vessel; if the trough is amidships the buoyancy forces will tend to 'sag' the ship.
[줄 3845] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - In a seaway the overall effect is an increase of bending moment from that in still water when the greater buoyancy variation is taken into account.
[줄 3846] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Longitudinal shear forces When the vessel hogs and sags in still water and at sea, shear forces similar to the vertical shear forces will be present in the longitudinal plane.
[줄 3847] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Vertical and longitudinal shear stresses are complementary and exist in conjunction with a change of bending moment between adjacent sections of the hull girder.
[줄 3848] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The magnitude of the longitudinal shear force is greatest at the neutral axis and decreases towards the top and bottom of the girder.
[줄 3849] [77.6%] (45/58) ✅ 유지 - Bending stresses From classic bending theory the bending stress at any point in a beam is given by: s 1⁄4 M I  y where M 1⁄4 applied bending moment, y 1⁄4 distance of point considered from neutral axis, and I 1⁄4 second moment of area of cross-section of beam about the neutral axis.

[줄 3851] [84.6%] (11/13) ✅ 유지 - Trough Trough SAGGING HOGGING Longitudinal shear forces Figure 8.2 Wave bending moments.
[줄 3852] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - When the beam bends it is seen that the extreme fibers are, say in the case of hogging, in tension at the top and in compression at the bottom.
[줄 3853] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Somewhere between the two there is a position where the fibers are neither in tension nor compression.
[줄 3854] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - This position is called the neutral axis, and at the furthest fibers from the neutral axis the greatest stress occurs for plane bending.
[줄 3855] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - It should be noted that the neutral axis always contains the center of gravity of the cross-section.
[줄 3856] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - In the equation the second moment of area of the section is a divisor; therefore, the greater the value of the second moment of area, the less the bending stress will be.
[줄 3857] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - This second moment of area of section varies as the depth squared and therefore a small increase in depth of section can be very beneficial in reducing the bending stress.
[줄 3858] [87.5%] (35/40) ✅ 유지 - Occasionally reference is made to the sectional modulus of a beam; this is simply the ratio between the second moment of area and the distance of the point considered from the neutral axis, i.e I / y 1⁄4 Z.
[줄 3859] [58.3%] (7/12) ❌ 제거 - The bending stress is then given by s 1⁄4 M / Z.
[줄 3860] [100.0%] (45/45) ✅ 유지 - The ship as a beam It was seen earlier that the ship bends like a beam, and in fact the hull can be considered as a box-shaped girder for which the position of the neutral axis and second moment of area may be calculated.
[줄 3861] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - The deck and bottom shell form the flanges of the hull girder, and are far more important to longitudinal strength than the sides that form the web of the girder and carry the shear forces.
[줄 3862] [87.5%] (14/16) ✅ 유지 - The box-shaped hull girder and a conventional I girder are compared in Figure 8.3.
[줄 3863] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - In a ship the neutral axis is generally nearer the bottom, since the bottom shell will be heavier than the deck, having to resist water pressure as well as the bending stresses.
[줄 3864] [100.0%] (42/42) ✅ 유지 - In calculating the second moment of an area of the cross-section all longitudinal material is of greatest importance and the further the material is from the neutral axis, the greater will be its second moment of area about the neutral axis.
[줄 3865] [97.1%] (33/34) ✅ 유지 - However, at greater distances from the neutral axis, the sectional modulus will be reduced and correspondingly higher stress may occur in extreme hull girder plates such as the deck stringer, sheer strake, and bilge.
[줄 3866] [90.0%] (9/10) ✅ 유지 - These strakes of plating are generally heavier than other plating.
[줄 3867] [90.0%] (27/30) ✅ 유지 - Bending stresses are greater over the middle portion of the length and it is owing to this variation that Lloyd's give maximum scantlings over 40% of the length amidships.
[줄 3868] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Other scantlings may taper towards the ends of the ship, apart from locally highly stressed regions where other forms of loading are encountered.
[줄 3869] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Strength deck The deck forming the uppermost flange of the main hull girder is often referred to as the strength deck.
[줄 3870] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This is to some extent a misleading term since all continuous decks are in fact strength decks if properly constructed.
[줄 3871] [97.7%] (43/44) ✅ 유지 - Along the length of the ship the top flange of the hull girder, i.e the strength deck, may step from deck to deck where large superstructures are fitted or there is a natural break, for instance in way of a raised quarter deck.
[줄 3872] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Larger superstructures tend to deform with the main hull and stresses of

[줄 3874] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - appreciable magnitude will occur in the structure.
[줄 3875] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Early vessels fitted with large superstructures of light construction demonstrated this to their cost.
[줄 3876] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Attempts to avoid fracture have been made by fitting expansion joints, which made the light structure discontinuous.
[줄 3877] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - These were not entirely successful and the expansion joint may itself form a stress concentration at the strength deck, which one would wish to avoid.
[줄 3878] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - In modern construction the superstructure is usually made continuous and of such strength that its sectional modulus is equivalent to that which the strength deck would have if no superstructure were fitted.
[줄 3879] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Transverse stresses When a ship experiences transverse forces these tend to change the shape of the vessel's cross-sections and thereby introduce transverse stresses.
[줄 3880] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - These forces may be produced by hydrostatic loads and impact of seas or cargo and structural weights, both directly and as the result of reactions due to change of ship motion.
[줄 3881] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - Racking When a ship is rolling, the deck tends to move laterally relative to the bottom structure, and the shell on one side to move vertically relative to the other side.
[줄 3882] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - This type of deformation is referred to as 'racking'.
[줄 3883] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Transverse bulkheads primarily resist such transverse deformation, the side frames' contribution being insignificant provided the transverse bulkheads are at their usual regular spacings.
[줄 3884] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - Where transverse bulkheads are widely spaced, deep web frames and beams may be introduced to compensate.
[줄 3885] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - When any body is subject to a twisting moment, which is commonly referred to as torque, that body is said to be in 'torsion'.
[줄 3886] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - A ship heading obliquely to a wave will be subjected to righting moments of opposite direction at its ends, twisting the hull and putting it in 'torsion'.
[줄 3887] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - In most ships these torsional moments and stresses are negligible but in ships with extremely wide and long deck openings they are significant.
[줄 3888] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - A particular example is the larger container ship, where at the topsides a heavy torsion box girder structure including the upper deck is provided to accommodate the torsional stresses.
[줄 3889] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - Local stresses Panting Panting refers to a tendency for the shell plating to work 'in' and 'out' in a bellowslike fashion, and is caused by the fluctuating pressures on the hull at the ends when the ship is amongst waves.
[줄 3890] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - These forces are most severe when the vessel is running into
[줄 3891] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - waves and is pitching heavily, the large pressures occurring over a short time cycle.
[줄 3892] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Strengthening to resist panting both forward and aft is covered in Chapter 17.
[줄 3893] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Pounding Severe local stresses occur in way of the bottom shell and framing forward when a vessel is driven into head seas.
[줄 3894] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - These pounding stresses, as they are known, are likely to be most severe in a lightly ballasted condition, and occur over an area of the bottom shell aft of the collision bulkhead.
[줄 3895] [92.9%] (13/14) ✅ 유지 - Additional stiffening is required in this region; this is dealt with in Chapter 16.
[줄 3896] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Other local stresses Ship structural members are often subjected to high stresses in localized areas, and great care is required to ensure that these areas are correctly designed.
[줄 3897] [91.7%] (33/36) ✅ 유지 - This is particularly the case where various load-carrying members of the ship intersect, examples being where longitudinals meet at transverse bulkheads and at intersections Crest Crest Container ship section Torsion box Figure 8.4 Torsion.
[줄 3898] [100.0%] (5/5) ✅ 유지 - of longitudinal and transverse bulkheads.
[줄 3899] [100.0%] (36/36) ✅ 유지 - Another highly stressed area occurs where there is a discontinuity of the hull girder at ends of deck house structures, also at hatch and other opening corners, and where there are sudden breaks in the bulwarks.
[줄 3900] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - Brittle fracture With the large-scale introduction of welding in ship construction, much consideration has been given to the correct selection of materials and structural design to prevent the possibility of brittle fracture occurring.
[줄 3901] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - During the Second World War the incidence of this phenomenon was high amongst tonnage hastily constructed, whilst little was known about the mechanics of brittle fracture.
[줄 3902] [100.0%] (43/43) ✅ 유지 - Although instances of brittle fracture were recorded in riveted ships, the consequences were more disastrous in the welded vessels because of the continuity of metal provided by the welded joint as opposed to the riveted lap, which tended to limit the propagating crack.
[줄 3903] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Brittle fracture occurs when an otherwise elastic material fractures without any apparent sign or little evidence of material deformation prior to failure.
[줄 3904] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - Fracture occurs instantaneously with little warning and the vessel's overall structure need not be subject to a high stress at the time.
[줄 3905] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Mild steel used extensively in ship construction is particularly prone to brittle fracture given the conditions necessary to trigger it off.
[줄 3906] [97.7%] (42/43) ✅ 유지 - The subject is too complex to be dealt with in detail in this text, but it is known that the following factors influence the possibility of brittle fracture and are taken into consideration in the design and material selection of modern ships: 1.
[줄 3907] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - A sharp notch is present in the structure from which the fracture initiates.
[줄 3908] [100.0%] (5/5) ✅ 유지 - A tensile stress is present.
[줄 3909] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - There is a temperature above which brittle fracture will not occur.
[줄 3910] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - The metallurgical properties of the steel plate.
[줄 3911] [100.0%] (5/5) ✅ 유지 - Thick plate is more prone.
[줄 3912] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - A brittle fracture is distinguishable from a ductile failure by the lack of deformation at the edge of the tear, and its bright granular appearance.
[줄 3913] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - A ductile failure has a dull gray appearance.
[줄 3914] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - The brittle fracture is also distinguished by the apparent chevron marking, which aids location of the fracture initiation point since these tend to point in that direction.
[줄 3915] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Factors that are known to exist where a brittle fracture may occur must be considered if this is to be avoided.
[줄 3916] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Firstly, the design of individual items of ship structure must be such that sharp notches where cracks may be initiated are avoided.
[줄 3917] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - With welded structures as large as a ship the complete elimination of crack initiation is not entirely possible owing to the existence of small faults in the welds, a complete weld examination not being practicable.
[줄 3918] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Steel specified for the hull construction should therefore have good 'notch ductility' at the service temperatures, particularly where thick plate is used.
[줄 3919] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Provision of steel having good 'notch ductility' properties has the effect of making it difficult for a crack to propagate.
[줄 3920] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Notch ductility is a measure of the relative toughness of the steel, which has already been seen to be determined by an impact test.
[줄 3921] [100.0%] (7/7) ✅ 유지 - Steels specified for ship construction have elements
[줄 3922] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - added, and may also be subjected to a controlled heat treatment, which will enhance the notch toughness properties.
[줄 3923] [88.9%] (16/18) ✅ 유지 - Figure 8.5 illustrates the improved notch ductility of a manganese/carbon steel against a plain carbon steel.
[줄 3924] [94.6%] (35/37) ✅ 유지 - Grade D and Grade E steels, which have higher notch ductility, are employed where thick plate is used and in way of higher stressed regions, as will be seen when the ship structural details are considered later.
[줄 3925] [95.7%] (22/23) ✅ 유지 - In association with the problem of brittle fracture it was not uncommon at one time to hear reference to the term 'crack arrester'.
[줄 3926] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - The term related to the now outdated practice of introducing riveted seams in cargo ships to subdivide the vessel into welded substructures so that any possible crack propagation was limited to the substructure.
[줄 3927] [88.9%] (16/18) ✅ 유지 - In particular, such a 'crack arrester' was usually specified in the sheerstrake/stringer plate area of larger ships.
[줄 3928] [93.3%] (14/15) ✅ 유지 - Today strakes of higher notch toughness steel are required to be fitted in such areas.
[줄 3929] [84.8%] (39/46) ✅ 유지 - Lloyd's Register, for example, require the mild steel sheerstrake and stringer plate at the strength deck over the midship portion of vessels of more than 250 meters length to be Grade D if less than 15 mm thick and Grade E if of greater thickness.
[줄 3930] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Fatigue failures Unlike brittle fracture, fatigue fracture occurs very slowly and can in fact take years to propagate.
[줄 3931] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - The greatest danger with fatigue fractures is that they occur at low stresses that are applied to a structure repeatedly over a period of time.
[줄 3932] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - A fatigue crack, once initiated, may grow unnoticed until the load-bearing member is reduced to a cross-sectional area that is insufficient to carry the applied load.
[줄 3933] [96.3%] (26/27) ✅ 유지 - Fatigue failures are associated with sharp notches or discontinuities in structures, and are especially prevalent at 'hard spots', i.e regions of high rigidity in ship structures.
[줄 3934] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - With the growth in size of oil tankers, bulk carriers, and container ships there has been increasing use of higher yield strength steels in their hull structures.
[줄 3935] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - The classification societies have subsequently placed special emphasis on analysis of the fatigue performance of these larger structures, usually over a 25-year life cycle, as part of their approval process.
[줄 3936] [100.0%] (37/37) ✅ 유지 - Buckling With the substantial increase in size of oil tankers, bulk carriers, and container ships in recent years, greater attention has had to be given to the buckling strength of the stiffened plate panels constituting the shell.
[줄 3937] [95.8%] (23/24) ✅ 유지 - Buckling of a structural member loaded in compression may occur at a stress level that is substantially lower than the material's yield stress.
[줄 3938] [89.3%] (25/28) ✅ 유지 - The load at which buckling occurs is a function of the structural member's geometry and the material's modulus of elasticity rather than the material's strength.
[줄 3939] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The most common example of buckling failure is the collapse of a pillar under a compressive load.
[줄 3940] [100.0%] (13/13) ✅ 유지 - A stiffened plate panel in compression will also have a critical buckling load

[줄 3953] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - Irrespective of the source of the owner's funds for purchasing the ship, payment to the shipbuilder is usually made as progress payments that are stipulated in the contract under item 7 above.
[줄 3954] [100.0%] (45/45) ✅ 유지 - A typical payment schedule may have been five equal payments spread over the contract period, but in recent years payment arrangements advantageous to the purchaser and intended to attract buyers to the shipyard have delayed a higher percentage of payment until delivery of the ship.
[줄 3955] [82.1%] (23/28) ✅ 유지 - The payment schedule may be as follows: 10% on signing contract 10% on arrival of materials on site 10% on keel laying 20% on launching 50% on delivery.
[줄 3956] [98.5%] (66/67) ✅ 유지 - Because many cargo ships are of a standard design, and built in series, and modification can be very disruptive to the shipyard building program, item 3 in the standard form of contract where modifications are called for at a late date by the owner can have a dramatic effect on costs and delivery date given the detail now introduced at an early stage of the fabrication process.
[줄 3957] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Many shipyards will refuse to accept modifications once a design is agreed and detailed work and purchasing commences.
[줄 3958] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - Item 3 also covers the costs and delays of compulsory modifications resulting from amendment of laws, rules, and regulations of the flag state and classification society.

[줄 3962] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - Unlike the pillar, however, slightly exceeding this load will not necessarily result in collapse of the plate but only in elastic deflection of the center portion of the plate from its initial plane.
[줄 3963] [92.9%] (13/14) ✅ 유지 - After removal of the load, the plate will return to its original undeformed state.
[줄 3964] [97.4%] (38/39) ✅ 유지 - The ultimate load that may be carried by a buckled plate is determined by the onset of yielding i.e when the yield point of the material is reached at some point in the plate or in the stiffeners.
[줄 3965] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - Once begun, this yielding may propagate rapidly throughout the stiffened panel with further increase in load until failure of the plate or stiffeners occurs.
[줄 3966] [93.9%] (31/33) ✅ 유지 - In recent years Lloyd's Register has introduced for oil tankers over 150 meters in length rules that contain formulae to check the buckling capacity of plate panels and their main supporting stiffeners.
[줄 3967] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Where further buckling assessment is required a computer-based general and local stiffened plate panel ultimate buckling strength evaluation assessment procedure is used.
[줄 3968] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - Monitoring ship stresses at sea In order to enhance safety during shipboard operations, real-time motion and stress monitoring information equipment can be supplied by classification societies such as Lloyd's Register to a ship at the owner's request.
[줄 3969] [93.1%] (27/29) ✅ 유지 - This entails the fitting of strain gages to the deck structure, an accelerometer, and a personal computer with software that displays ship stress and motion readings on the bridge.

[줄 3997] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - The most commonly used gas in use is acetylene, which gives an intense concentrated flame when burnt in oxygen.
[줄 3998] [100.0%] (40/40) ✅ 유지 - An oxyacetylene flame has two distinct regions: an inner cone, in which the oxygen for combustion is supplied via the torch; and a surrounding envelope, in which some or all the oxygen for combustion is drawn from the surrounding air.
[줄 3999] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - By varying the ratio of oxygen to acetylene in the gas mixture supplied by the torch, it is possible to vary the efficiency of the combustion and alter the nature of the flame.
[줄 4000] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - If the oxygen supply is slightly greater than the supply of acetylene by volume, what is known as an 'oxidizing' flame is obtained.
[줄 4001] [90.9%] (30/33) ✅ 유지 - This type of flame may be used for welding materials of high thermal conductivity, e.g copper, but not steels, as the steel may be decarburized and the weld pool depleted of silicon.

[줄 4016] [100.0%] (39/39) ✅ 유지 - Oxyacetylene welding tends to be slower than other fusion welding processes because the process temperature is low in comparison with the melting temperature of the metal, and because the heat must be transferred from the flame to the plate.
[줄 4017] [90.3%] (28/31) ✅ 유지 - The process is therefore only really applicable to thinner mild steel plate, thicknesses up to 7 mm being welded using this process with a speed of 3–4 meters per hour.

[줄 4097] [100.0%] (35/35) ✅ 유지 - At low currents metal transfer in the arc is rather difficult and very little fusion of the plate results, which has made the welding of light aluminum plate rather difficult with the MIG/argon process.

[줄 4279] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The strongest welded joint that may be produced in two plates subsequently subjected to a tensile pull is the butt joint.
[줄 4280] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - A butt joint is one where the two joined plates are in the same plane, and in any welded structure it is desirable that butt joints should be used wherever possible.
[줄 4281] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - In mild steel the weld metal tends to have a higher yield strength than the plate material.
[줄 4282] [100.0%] (29/29) ✅ 유지 - Under tension it is found that initial yielding usually occurs adjacent to a butt weld in the plate when the yield strength of the plate material is reached locally.
[줄 4283] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Since a good butt weld in tension has a strength equivalent to that of the mild steel plate, it is not considered as a line of structural weakness.
[줄 4284] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - Lapped joints, where fillet welds are used to connect the plates, should be avoided in strength members of a welded structure.
[줄 4285] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - As the fillet welds are in shear when the plates are in tension, the strength of the joint is very much less than that of the plate material or butt joint.
[줄 4286] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Fillet welds are unavoidable where sections or plates are connected at an angle to an adjacent plate, but often there is not the same problem as the loading is different.
[줄 4287] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The fatigue strength of fillet welds is also inferior to that of a butt weld.
[줄 4288] [95.0%] (38/40) ✅ 유지 - Welding practice In making a butt weld with manual arc welding, where the plate thickness exceeds, say, 5–6 mm it will become necessary to make more than one welding pass to deposit sufficient weld metal to close the joint.
[줄 4289] [100.0%] (8/8) ✅ 유지 - With the higher current automatic welding Ship Construction.
[줄 4290] [100.0%] (3/3) ✅ 유지 - All rights reserved.

[줄 4292] [83.3%] (15/18) ✅ 유지 - Ideally 45 ° Width Figure 10.1 Stress–strain relationship for parent/weld metals and butt/fillet weld detail.
[줄 4293] [100.0%] (19/19) ✅ 유지 - processes thicker plates may be welded with a single pass, but at greater thicknesses multi-pass welds become necessary.
[줄 4294] [100.0%] (32/32) ✅ 유지 - In ship work unless a permanent backing bar is used, or a 'one-sided' welding technique or process is used, a back run of weld is required to ensure complete weld penetration.
[줄 4295] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - This is made on the reverse side of the joint after cleaning out the slag, etc. by chipping or gouging.
[줄 4296] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Permanent backing bars may conveniently be introduced where it is desired to weld from one side only during erection at the berth.
[줄 4297] [100.0%] (34/34) ✅ 유지 - A good example is the use of a cut-down channel bar used as a deck beam, the upper flange providing the backing bar for a deck panel butt weld, made by machine above.
[줄 4298] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - Tack welds are used throughout the construction to hold plates and sections in place after alignment and prior to completion of the full butt or fillet weld.
[줄 4299] [100.0%] (27/27) ✅ 유지 - These are short light runs of weld metal, which may be welded over, or cut out in more critical joints during the final welding of the joint.
[줄 4300] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Fillet welds may be continuous or intermittent depending on the structural effectiveness of the member to be welded.
[줄 4301] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Where fillets are intermittent they may be either staggered or chain welded, the member may also be scalloped to give the same result when continuously welded.
[줄 4302] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - On thicker plates it becomes necessary to bevel the edges of plates that are to be butted together in order to achieve complete penetration of the weld metal.
[줄 4303] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - This operation may be carried out whilst profiling or trimming the plate edges, which must be aligned correctly.
[줄 4304] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Most edge preparations are made by gas or plasma heads having three nozzles out of phase that can be set at different angles to give the required bevels.
[줄 4305] [100.0%] (18/18) ✅ 유지 - Alternatively, the edge preparation may be obtained by mechanical machining methods using either a planing or milling tool.
[줄 4306] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - For very high quality welds in thick plate, particularly of the higher tensile types of steel, mechanical machining may well be specified.
[줄 4307] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - It is worth noting that there is little to choose between the two as far as metallurgical damage goes, but mechanical methods provide a better finish.
[줄 4308] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Plates of varying thickness may be butt welded together at different locations, a good example being where heavy insert plates are fitted.
[줄 4309] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - Insert plates are preferred to doubling plates in welded construction, and the heavy plate is chamfered to the thickness of the adjacent thinner plate before the butt edge preparation is made.
[줄 4310] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - To ease the assembly of welded units it is common practice to make use of what is known as an 'egg box' construction.
[줄 4311] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Within the double-bottom unit the floors and side girders may be slotted at their intersections so that they fit neatly together prior to construction.
[줄 4312] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - Welding automation Larger shipyards with a large production line throughput of welded panels use automated welding systems to produce the stiffened panels.
[줄 4313] [91.7%] (11/12) ✅ 유지 - To join the plates, highspeed one-sided submerged arc welding is used.
[줄 4314] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The required welding parameters are set in advance in the operation box and linked to a computer.
[줄 4315] [100.0%] (10/10) ✅ 유지 - The operator selects the plate thickness and starts the machine.

[줄 4320] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - The welded plate panel is then moved over floor-mounted rollers to the next stage where the stiffening members are to be attached.
[줄 4321] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - Each stiffener is lowered onto the plate panel and tack welded using metal arc gas-shielded welding.
[줄 4322] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - The plate panel with tacked stiffeners is then rolled within reach of a fillet welding gantry with double-fillet welding machines.
[줄 4323] [100.0%] (31/31) ✅ 유지 - The gantry moves parallel to the stiffeners at the same speed as the welding heads and carries packs containing the welding wires and power sources for the double-fillet welding heads.
[줄 4324] [92.3%] (12/13) ✅ 유지 - Welding is carried out using flux-cored wires with CO 2 gas shielding.
[줄 4325] [91.7%] (11/12) ✅ 유지 - The use of robotics for welding is referred to in Chapter 13.
[줄 4326] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Welding distortion During the welding process the metal is heated, which causes expansion and the metal then contracts on cooling.
[줄 4327] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - The initial rapid heating causes the welded area to expand locally.
[줄 4328] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - The slower cooling of the weld causes the plate to move as the weld contracts.
[줄 4329] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The result is a distortion of the part, and this is a major cause of extra work during assembly of units and construction of the ship.
[줄 4330] [100.0%] (17/17) ✅ 유지 - The need to adjust distorted parts so that they fit correctly can take considerable time and effort.
[줄 4331] [100.0%] (9/9) ✅ 유지 - In-plane distortion is basically shrinkage of the plate.
[줄 4332] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - For repeatable processes, which are usual in shipbuilding, the shrinkage can be measured and sufficient data built up to allow the shrinkage to be predicted.
[줄 4333] [100.0%] (30/30) ✅ 유지 - Computer-aided design systems can now include an allowance for shrinkage, so that the part as modeled in the system can then be adjusted during the generation of cutting information.
[줄 4334] [93.8%] (15/16) ✅ 유지 - The plates are cut oversized and the shrinkage after welding brings it to the correct size.
[줄 4335] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - More recently, work has been carried out to model shrinkage of more complex parts, for example structural webs with face flats.
[줄 4336] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Again, these parts can then have their dimensions adjusted prior to cutting so that the effect of shrinkage is to bring them to the correct shape.
[줄 4337] [90.9%] (10/11) ✅ 유지 - Out-ofplane distortion is much more difficult to predict and manage.
[줄 4338] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - The cause is the same as in-plane shrinkage, but the distortion is often associated with fillet welds used to attach stiffeners to plates.
[줄 4339] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The fillet welds, as they shrink, pull the plate out of plane, resulting in the typical appearance of a welded hull with indentations between the frames.
[줄 4340] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - The effect is much more noticeable for thin plate structures, for smaller ships, and for superstructures.
[줄 4341] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Restraining the plate during assembly and welding is one commonly used solution.
[줄 4342] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - The causes of distortion are complex and also include any residual stresses in the steel plate as a result of the steel mill rolling and cooling.
[줄 4343] [100.0%] (23/23) ✅ 유지 - Some of the stress may be relieved by rolling the plate prior to production, but distortion remains a significant problem for many shipbuilders.
[줄 4344] [96.7%] (29/30) ✅ 유지 - Welding sequences In order to minimize distortion in manual welding the 'backstep' and 'wandering' methods of welding are often used, the length of each step being the amount of weld
[줄 4345] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - metal laid down by an electrode to suit the required cross-section of weld.
[줄 4346] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - To reduce distortion and limit the residual stresses in the structure it is important that a correct welding sequence should be utilized throughout the construction.
[줄 4347] [100.0%] (16/16) ✅ 유지 - This applies both during the fabrication of units and at erection and joining on the berth.
[줄 4348] [100.0%] (25/25) ✅ 유지 - Of the more important welds in the construction of the ship the sequences involving welding of butts and seams in plating panels may be considered.
[줄 4349] [63.9%] (46/72) ✅ 유지 - At T intersections it is necessary to weld the butt first fully, then gouge BACKSTEP METHOD OF WELDING Direction of weld Direction of weld Direction of weld Direction of weld 6 6 5 4 4 2 3 5 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 3 3 5 4 2 5 4 6 6 Progression of welder Progression of welder Progression of welder Progression of welder WANDERING METHOD OF WELDING WELD DISTORTION

[줄 4355] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Welding the seam first would cause high restraint across the plate strake and when the butt was finished a crack might occur.
[줄 4356] [100.0%] (24/24) ✅ 유지 - General practice when welding shell panels is to start by welding the central butts and then adjacent seams, working outwards both transversely and longitudinally.
[줄 4357] [100.0%] (28/28) ✅ 유지 - Ships' structural panels have various forms of stiffener attached to the plate panels, these generally being welded to the panel after completing the welding of the panel plates.
[줄 4358] [96.2%] (25/26) ✅ 유지 - These stiffening members are left unwelded across the butts and seams of the plates until these are completed, if they are attached at some intermediate stage.
[줄 4359] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Erection welding sequences generally follow the principles laid down for plating panels.
[줄 4360] [100.0%] (22/22) ✅ 유지 - In welded ships the lower side plating seams should not be welded before the upper seams, particularly the deck and gunwale seams.
[줄 4361] [100.0%] (33/33) ✅ 유지 - If this sequence of welding the side shell were adopted the upper portion of the hull structure would tend to be shortened, causing the hull to rise from the blocks at the ends.
[줄 4362] [100.0%] (26/26) ✅ 유지 - Where in modern construction the side shell and deck plating are erected in blocks and a suitable welding sequence is employed, this problem does not arise.
[줄 4363] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - In repair work correct welding sequences are also important, particularly where new material is fitted into the existing relatively rigid structure.
[줄 4364] [100.0%] (14/14) ✅ 유지 - Again, the procedure follows the general pattern for butts and seams in plate panels.
[줄 4365] [94.9%] (37/39) ✅ 유지 - If a new shell plate is to be welded in place the seams and butts in the surrounding structure are cut back 300–375 mm from the opening, likewise the connection of the stiffening in way of the opening.
[줄 4366] [93.8%] (30/32) ✅ 유지 - The inserted plate panel is then welded to within 300–375 mm of the free edges, the butts are completed, and then the seams after welding any longitudinal stiffening across the butts.
[줄 4367] [100.0%] (11/11) ✅ 유지 - Finally, the vertical framing is welded in way of the seams.
[줄 4368] [100.0%] (20/20) ✅ 유지 - Testing welds For economic reasons much of the weld testing carried out in shipbuilding is done visually by trained inspectors.
[줄 4369] [95.5%] (21/22) ✅ 유지 - Spot checks at convenient intervals are made on the more important welds in merchant ship construction, generally using radiographic or ultrasonic equipment.
[줄 4370] [96.0%] (24/25) ✅ 유지 - Welding materials are subjected to comprehensive tests before they are approved by Lloyd's Register or the other classification societies for use in ship work.
[줄 4371] [100.0%] (15/15) ✅ 유지 - Operatives are required to undergo periodical welder approval tests to ascertain their standard of workmanship.
[줄 4372] [100.0%] (12/12) ✅ 유지 - Weld faults Various faults may be observed in butt and fillet welds.
[줄 4373] [100.0%] (21/21) ✅ 유지 - These may be due to a number of factors: bad design, incorrect welding procedure, use of wrong materials, and bad workmanship.
[줄 4374] [75.0%] (6/8) ✅ 유지 - Different faults are illustrated in Figure 10.5.
[줄 4375] [96.8%] (30/31) ✅ 유지 - The judgment of the seriousness of the fault rests with the weld inspector and surveyor, and where the weld is considered to be unacceptable it will be cut out and rewelded.
